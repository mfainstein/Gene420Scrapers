        "description": "One of the original landrace strains that precipitated the popularization of cannabis throughout the world, Hindu Kush is a potent pure indica. It is indigenous to the Hindu Kush mountain chain that forms the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The meaning of the word “Kush” is disputed, and has been traced back to a Persian term for “Hindu killer” (in reference to the danger of crossing the inhospitable mountains) as well as to Avestan words meaning simply “water mountain.” In any case, Kush has become a byword for weed and is often used a suffix in the names of different strains, regardless of whether those strains have Hindu Kush in their lineage.\n\nSeeds of Hindu Kush -- along with seeds of other Asian landrace varieties like Afghani -- were brought to the U.S. in the 1960s and 70s by cannabis enthusiasts and explorers who traveled along a route that has come to be known as the “hippie trail.” In time, Hindu Kush has, perhaps inevitably, been crossed with other strains to allow for stability and adaptation to a radically different climate than its mountainous point of origin; as such, “true” Hindu Kush may not be widely available in the Western Hemisphere. Nevertheless, Hindu Kush is a relatively pure strain, simpler and often more potent that the novelty crossbreeds that continue to multiply in today’s competitive cannabis market. It is prized for its heavily sedative, almost narcotic properties and its highly resinous flowers. The THC composition of Hindu Kush is typically measured at between 15% and 20%.\n\nHindu Kush is marked by large, clustered green buds that adhere due to their incredibly sticky consistency. Some phenotypes have shades of purple in the leaves, the result of high concentrations of plant pigments called anthocyanins being activated by cold weather during the vegetative stage. The densely-packed flowers are famous for their resin (Hindu Kush may have been one of the first strains used to produce hash) and have a heavy coating of silver-white trichomes. The aroma of this strain is very complex, with a simultaneously sweet and musky scent, redolent of spice, sandalwood, pine, and wet earth. The musky odor intensifies when flowers are combusted and smoked. The resulting smoke is harsh and cough-inducing; when exhaled, smoke tastes vaguely like pine. The overall flavor impression of Hindu Kush is one of incense and herbs.\n\nHindu Kush boasts a slowly-mounting high that begins as a sense of physical relaxation and then progresses toward a state of mental fogginess. Users will feel a heavy sensation in the limbs and head and may not want to be especially active. The feeling of couchlock is commonly reported: users may have thoughts or intentions of getting up to perform a task, but will just as happily remain motionless. This immobilization can free up the mind for lazy contemplation and meandering creative thinking. Some psychedelic effects like visual distortions and strange tactile sensations may also be present. Because of its heavy body stone, Hindu Kush is not recommended for active daytime use. Instead, it works well as a numbing agent for chronic pain, an anti-nausea treatment, and as a way to relieve stress and anxiety. Negative effects include dry mouth and eyes, occasionally accompanied by paranoia and dizziness. A few users have also reported experiencing anxiety from larger doses of this strain. Hindu Kush is particularly helpful for users with insomnia, as large enough doses can induce sleep.\n\nThe purely indica lineage of Hindu Kush is evident in its stature. Indica plants are much shorter and stockier than their sativa counterparts, and the Hindu Kush strain epitomizes this, hardly ever growing taller than 5 feet. As such, it can be grown indoors, provided that multiple plants are spaced to allow for the strain’s wide lateral branches. Outdoor cultivation tends to be more difficult, as the strain’s native climate is highly variable. However, as noted, certain varieties of Hindu Kush have been stabilized through minor crossbreeding, so some phenotypes may grow well outdoors. Growers may want to trim low-lying branches (which can later be used to grow clones) to allow for easy air circulation. Growers should also trim broad fan leaves to allow light to penetrate to flowering nodes up and down the length of the plant. When cultivated indoors, Hindu Kush flowers anywhere between 7 to 10 weeks. If grown outside, plants are usually ready for harvest in late October. Hindu Kush can yield up to 1.5 oz per square foot and reach a THC count of up to 20%.\n\nProcuring Hindu Kush is a unique encounter for the cannabis novice and connoisseur alike. Shaped over countless generations of natural selection, its aromatic flowers offer a way to experience a piece of botanical and cultural history. The strain’s powerful knockout high may introduce a new kind of respect for nature -- or at the very least, an understanding of why this plant has been selectively bred by humans for centuries. A true nighttime smoke, Hindu Kush is well-suited to solo use or to small intimate gatherings.\n\n"

This strain is known to be very thought provoking as well. New users may find the body buzz imparted by this strain as strong enough to be narcotic and couch-locking.Orange Bud cannot escape delivering the common downsides to cannabis use, which include dry mouth and eyes, paranoia, anxiety and headaches especially when consumed in larger doses.For the majority of medical users this strain will be useful all day long, especially when providing relief from even severe aches and pains due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The mood elevating effects of Orange Bud may help reduce anxiety and stress as well. It may also be used to calm nausea, and for some, fight off the effects of insomnia.Orange Bud was developed by Dutch Passion as a combination of two pure bred skunks of unknown origins. The strain can be grown by growers with any level of experience both indoor and out. Requiring between eight and nine weeks to finish flowering, Orange Bud does particularly well in a Sea of Green technique. Since the introduction of the original Orange Bud, there have been at least two other strains that have also been named Orange Bud but are bred with various other strains.\n\n\n"

Such a rare taste delivers a powerful high that most often energizes users and activates their minds. This activation usually comes coupled with uplifting feelings of euphoria and a burst of insightful creativity. Accompanying these effects are a mildly numbing body stone that can cause some users, especially new users, to feel more lazy and in need of a seat or sleep. NYC Diesel also comes with a powerful “munchies effect” and the common downsides of dry mouth and eyes, paranoia, headaches and dizziness.\nTypically, this Sativa strain is used as ‘wake and bake’ medication to start off many medical users' day full of energy, but for some it may need to be relegated to afternoon use as its high can be quite powerful.\nAs with many other cerebral highs, NYC Diesel is often chosen by patients seeking relief from stress, anxiety and depression related disorders. Even so the strain’s bodily effects are strong enough that they may make mild to moderate chronic aches and pains more manageable. Finally the powerful munchies effect is useful to those looking to increase their appetite and beat various eating disorders.\nNYC Diesel comes from Soma Seeds and as the story goes Soma received these seed from a friend in the Big Apple. The friend claimed that the stuff in the bag was the best he had ever had and since the guy had dreads down to the floor, Soma believed him and kept a couple. Reportedly the genetics for this strain are a cross between a Mexican Sativa and an Afghani. Capable of growing both indoors and out, this strain does best inside. Unfortunately many stray from trying to grow this strain as the flowering can take up to 85 days.\n\n"

        "description": "Sometimes shock value can be a big asset when naming and marketing strains. Originally called “Cush”, this strain was re-dubbed “Green Crack” by none other than cannabis connoisseur Snoop Dogg after he sampled its intense sativa effects. Although some still prefer the name Cush to sidestep any unwanted cannabis stigma, the love for this fruity and earthy strain is unanimous. Green Crack’s origins are disputed -- originally bred in Athens, GA in the 1970s, it is descended from the ever-popular Skunk #1, but it may also have some Afghani landrace indica in its background. It delivers a trippy and energetic high that’s perfect for daytime use. Its potency -- Green Crack averages 16% THC content -- ensures that you’ll feel uplifted for hours to come.\n\nGreen Crack has a classically indica bud structure, with dense buds that are more small and clustered than chunky. The leaves are pale green to yellow, although the pigments in some phenotypes can cause some leaves to be streaked with purple when plants are exposed to cold during the growing process. Rust-colored pistils stand out against the colorful flowers. The buds are also coated in milky-white trichomes, giving them a sticky texture and a glistening appearance. This visual appeal is matched by a dynamic scent. Cured properly, the flowers have a bright citrus scent with mellow undertones of earthiness and wood. The smoke is very smooth, and leaves a tang at the top of the palate and the back of the tongue, reminiscent of mango. On the exhale, smoke tastes vaguely hashy and spicy, perhaps evidence of Afghani in its lineage.\n\nDespite mostly indica physical characteristics, Green Crack has a strong and buzzy sativa high.  It provides users with a boost of energy that soon manifests as a cerebral mindset, making this an excellent wake and bake strain. Green Crack’s potency can make mundane like dishes and laundry tasks more interesting. It’s also an inspiring smoke -- its sharp sense of focus can help users zero in on creative projects or can draw attention to the nuances in a piece of music or a movie. Green Crack can also have some slightly psychedelic effects, including visual distortions and, particularly, an odd sense of time dilation. Because it can leave users feeling uplifted and fairly wired, this strain isn’t recommended for use late at night. Because it doesn’t have many physically relaxing indica properties, Green Crack doesn’t have a wide range of medical benefits. However, its energizing effects can be great for freeing users from fatigue. Green Crack can also aid those suffering from anxiety and depression, helping them to live in the moment -- although in large enough doses, the tendency towards recursive cerebral thinking can plunge some into panic or paranoia.\n\nGreen Crack is a relatively easy strain to grow, and a good choice for newcomers to cultivation. It can flourish indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a stable source of sunlight and consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It’s more easily grown indoors where conditions can be controlled. Plants can reach between 3 and 4 feet tall with strong lateral branching. Growers should practice “topping” when growing these plants, which involves trimming broad leaves at the top of the plant to allow light to reach the lower stalks and produce as many buds as possible. Green Crack flowers relatively quickly for a sativa, reaching maturity between 7 and 8 weeks when grown inside and ready for harvest in October when grown outdoors. The yield is average but solid, producing about 41 to 46 grams (or about 1.4 to 1.6 ounces) per square footage of plant. Growers should also take care to properly cure the harvested buds in order to preserve Green Crack’s taste and potency -- curing involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.\n\nDespite the edginess of its name, Green Crack is more likely to make users energized and inspired than strung out and manic. Providing the best of what sativa varieties have to offer, it’s a great strain for enhancing your appreciation of your surroundings or simply as a way to help you get up and go. It’s also unique in its potency -- even for more experienced cannabis fans, a little bit of this controlled substance can go a long way.\n\n"

        "description": "Sour Diesel, sometimes abbreviated as Sour D, is an extremely popular strain, distinguished by the fuel-like chemical smell of its flowers. It has a mostly sativa head high with some subtle physical indica relaxation, making it popular among recreational and medical users alike. This is a potent strain, with a THC content that had been measured at between 20% and 25%.\n\nBecause the underground cannabis market of the 1980s and 90s operated without any kind of lasting documentation, the exact origins of Sour Diesel are not known. Although a definitive agreement on its original genetic makeup doesn't exist, Sour Diesel’s popularity has made it the subject of much speculation. Some believe that true Sour Diesel was derived as a distinct phenotype of an original strain simply named Diesel. Others say that it was a phenotype of Chemdawg that leaned more sativa than indica. Still others claim that it was a cross of Chemdawg and Northern Lights, or perhaps Chemdawg, Northern Lights and Skunk #1.\n\nSour Diesel has round, medium-sized buds with leaves that appear yellowish-green. Red hairs called pistils, structures that operate to catch pollen from male plants, contrast with the densely-packed leaves. When properly cured, the flowers are somewhat sticky -- the dusting of trichomes is not as immediately obvious as it is on more resinous strains like White Widow. Nevertheless, breaking open buds reveals trichomes coating the insides of the dense flowers. The buds have an overpowering smell that, true to this strain’s name, is very similar to gasoline. The odor also has some hints of orange. Breaking open or grinding the buds intensifies this scent, and adds components of musk and pine sap. Sour Diesel has a notoriously harsh, acrid smoke that can cause users to cough or make their sinuses water. The smoke has a sour and vaguely skunky taste that may describe as unpleasant; on the exhale, the diesel and almost ammonia-like tang stings the palate and may linger for a long time afterward. Smokers trying to remain discreet should be warned that this is a very pungent strain whose odor can carry for quite a distance.\n\nThe high from Sour Diesel comes on users quickly in the form of a warm and pleasant head rush. An uplift in mood may be noticeable as well. Although Sour Diesel stimulates synaptic activity in the brain, the character of this head high is more spacey than intensely cerebral. Users may feel chatty if surrounded by others or somewhat introspective if enjoying the strain alone. For many, this soaring high is partially anchored by a slight feeling of physical relaxation. That said, a body stone that leads to full-on couchlock is rare. The sense of euphoria that comes with this variety may be helpful in treating some symptoms of mild stress, anxiety, or depression. Its tendency to lead to associative thinking may provoke a bit of creative inspiration. Fans of the strain also describe relief from troublesome aches and pains. Sour Diesel’s combination of mental and somatic effects may also make it a potent aphrodisiac in certain situations. As is common with many strong sativas, the altered mental state brought about by Sour Diesel may prove overwhelming for some, leading to paranoid, recursive thinking or a feeling of being generally “out of control” of one’s thoughts or body. As such, users -- especially those with a lower THC tolerance -- should adjust their intake accordingly. Sour Diesel has an average-length high that lasts about 2 to 3 hours.\n\nSeeds of Sour Diesel are packaged and available for sale from several seed bank retailers. Growers can also raise plants as clones, taking clippings taken from fully grown plants of the same strain. Sour Diesel can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation requires semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants are more characteristically sativa than indica, with a tall, spindly appearance and large spaces between flowering nodes. Plants can grow to be over four feet tall, with their height increasing exponentially during the flowering stage. For those growing indoors, bending and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage may help train the plants to fit within limited vertical space. Sour Diesel flowers within 10 weeks when grown indoors and around early November when grown outdoors. It has a moderately high yield: growers can expect between 42 and 56 grams (or between 1.5 and 2 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\nSour Diesel’s energized and positive high makes it easy to see why the strain enjoys popularity across the United States. It has spawned popular and flavorful strains like Sour Tsunami and Sour Jack and inspired strains like NYC Diesel, which imitates its unique taste. It’s as enjoyable in lively social situations as it is when used alone, and its combination of physical and mental effects makes it versatile enough to suit the user’s purpose.\n\n"

In the 60s, when Maui Waui was bred, the THC content of an average marijuana strain was quite low (almost always under 8%). Maui Waui featured THC content well into the teens and quickly became one of the most desired strains available.\n\nThese days, it is considered to be a middle to high grade medication that provides a typical Sativa high with a few Indica perks. Other strains (along with new hybrids) have caught up and even surpassed this legendary strain in THC content.\n\nFrequent users of Maui Waui report a happy and energetic high that can also increase creativity. It provides a light and pleasant body numbing sensation as well as a strong case of the stereotypical 'munchies.' Users may expect dry eyes and mouth and possible paranoia. Some also encounter dizziness and headaches when consuming larger doses or edibles.\n\nThe Sativa effects of this strain can relieve stress, anxiety, and chronic depression. Maui Waui's Indica side may be useful for easing minor chronic aches and pains. It is also used to stimulate appetite in those with anorexia and other eating disorders. Some users also use Maui Waui as medication for chronic migraine.\n\nMaui Waui originated as an outdoor grow on the island of Maui and almost immediately spread to all the Hawaiian Islands. Unfortunately the strain's exact genetics are not known. The plants of this strain show their true heritage in their height, usually reaching around 175 centimeters. Outside, Maui Waui should only be grown in a tropical climate. When grown in a tropical climate, Maui Waui is fairly resistant to molds and mildew as well as disease.\n\n"

It is 85% Sativa and is a cross between a pure Jamaican Indica and Early Pearl (Sativa).\n\nThe strain's high is creative and happy, energizing most users. It's great for morning use because of its energizing and uplifting nature. It can also help patients feel focused, especially those with adult ADD/ADHD. Jamaican Pearl is most often recommended for the treatment of anxiety, stress, or mood disorders.\n\nJamaican Pearl's Indica lineage produces a mild body stone, which some people find helpful for minor body aches. It has been known to calm nausea, settle stomachs, and increase appetites. Recently, some users have also been choosing this strain to help manage their migraines.\n\nThis strain has few negative effects. Most users experience only the standard dry mouth and eyes. Paranoia and dizziness are not common. \n\nJamaican Pearl reportedly yields up to 400 grams per square meter, even when grown by novices. It requires more carbon dioxide and high quality nutrients than your average Sativa. As with most Sativa strains, however, the plants grow tall and have the desired elongated buds. It grows quite well in nearly all outdoor environments. Using the Sea of Green technique, it can also be cultivated indoors. Flowering from anywhere between 50 and 70 days, the strain is ready for harvest in October when grown outside.\n\n"

This hazy high is both euphoric and uplifting and conducive to creativity. It has also been known to induce the munchies. The strain produces classic cotton mouth and dry eyes side effects but is also likely to cause paranoia and headaches. Some users may also experience dizziness.\n\nThe dreamy and happy high can be helpful in relieving stress, anxiety, and depression. Haze can also ease some minor chronic aches and pains, but it is not an ideal strain for severe pain. Some patients also choose this strain to stimulate their appetites and calm nausea.\n\nHaze was developed by the Haze Brothers, Sam the Skunkman, Wernard, Neville, and Eddie Reedeker. It is a cross between four different landrace Sativas: Mexican, Colombian, Thai, and Indian. According to the Skunkman, the Haze Brothers had a falling out in the late 1970s and never sold Haze seeds under the name. Since then, several strains used the name Haze, all of which are descended from the original.\n\nAs with most Sativa strains, Haze grows tall and thin, reaching up to 180cm. Haze's flowering period starts at ten to twelve weeks. The strain is recommended for indoor or desert climate growing and can yield up to 400 grams per 1000 watts.\n\n"

Either they love it or they're not fond of it at all. Those whom attest to it being amongst the best they have ever had love the strain because of the purely cerebral high it produces. It reportedly fills users uplifting feelings of a mellow happiness and a positive creativity. The strain can have a faint body high but with no couchlock; leaving many users feeling energized. Most users recommend having food on hand as Cat Piss induces powerful munchies, despite the unappetizing name. Aside from the expected dry eyes and cotton mouth users may experience paranoia and dizziness. Some users also have headaches while using this strain.\n\nDue to the Sativa properties of its high Cat Piss is most often used by those that cope with stress and anxiety disorders. It is also used by many to treat the overwhelming feelings of chronic depression. Some with chronic minor aches and pains have recommended Cat Piss as a good day starter thanks to the energy it can impart. Thanks to the previously mentioned munchies effect, the strain is also used by some who suffer from nausea and/or appetite loss. Cat Piss is also used as an anti-inflammatory.\n\nCat Piss was originally a phenotype of Super Silver Haze, making the strain clone only. A second strain using the same name has since appeared and most believe it to be a cross between the original and Trainwreck. True Cat Piss can grow well with both inside and outdoor setups. It is known to have a moderately sized yield; with the right care it can produce a significant amount of trichome covered bud. The strain flowers anywhere between 55 and 65 days. Being Sativa dominant, the strain can grow very tall.\n\n"

        "description": "Blue Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid that has been recognized by consulting firm BDS Analytics as the most popular strain circulating in 2015 -- and with good reason. A cross of indica Blueberry and sativa Haze, it offers a universally appealing taste and a long-lasting, well-rounded high. Smokers enjoy the ideal balance of cerebral stimulation and physical relaxation. After enjoying a cult following in California, it has become a top seller in Colorado and Washington. Thanks to aggressive branding, it may soon find a home in newly legal east coast cannabis markets as well. Samples of Blue Dream have tested at between 15% and 25% THC.\n\nBlue Dream has small to medium-sized buds that, when cured, have a popcorn-like, nugget shape. The leaves are primarily dark green. Interestingly, few phenotypes show the blue to lavender hues so often associated with parent strain Blueberry. Blue Dream’s plentiful trichomes are often clear in color, meaning that, while sticky to the touch, leaves don't always have the same silvery sheen as other resinous strains, nevertheless, these flowers are very sticky and can be tricky to break up without use of a grinder. Buds of Blue Dream have a skunky-sweet smell with strong notes of berry and grape. There are also vaguely spicy and herbal undertones, evidence of the genetics inherited from parent strain Haze. This strain gives off a harsh smoke that can sting the sinuses and often induce coughing. On the exhale, the smoke retains a berry flavor, with some hints of herbs and musk. The odor from Blue Dream can linger for a while, and smokers concerned with discretion should take precautions.\n\nThe complex high from this strain starts off with a bracing head rush that grabs users quickly. Some changes in perception, like amplified sounds and colors, may be noticeable although not disorienting. This psychedelic effect may help smokers have an increased appreciation for music, art, or just rambling conversation. Blue Dream's head-focused effects are soon met with a palpable sense of physical relaxation that spreads throughout the body. For the duration of the high, users enjoy a balance of mental invigoration and physical calm that lends itself to their setting or mood. Socializing, exercise, sex, and even lazy daydreaming can all be enhanced by this strain. Blue Dream also has medical uses that are just as versatile. Its relaxing indica effects make it an effective analgesic for troubling aches and pains; whether incidental, as in cases of injury, or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia . Its mellow euphoria can also relieve some symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Many users have also described improvement in the severity of migraines. In large enough doses, Blue Dream can have semi-narcotic properties to help treat those suffering from insomnia.\n\n\"True\" Blue Dream may only be available for cultivation as a clone; luckily, this strain's popularity means that many growers freely circulate clippings. Packaged seeds are also available for sale, although these may come from \"imitation\" Blue Dream varieties, bred from Blueberry and OG Kush. It can be grown outdoors in humid, Mediterranean-like climates, and has the advantage of being resistant to mildew; although growers should know that Blue Dream can also be vulnerable to spider mites. The plants are relatively short and bushy with wide lateral branches, making them easy to grow indoors. Growers will want to practice \"topping\" in the vegetative stage by trimming broad fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to allow sunlight and air to circulate among lower branches. Blue Dream flowers within 10 weeks when cultivated inside and offers a higher than average yield of 56 grams (or about 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nEnjoying wide availability and a high that’s friendly to novices and experienced users alike, Blue Dream shows no sign of losing its status as one of the most popular strains in the U.S. Boasting large amounts of sticky, THC-filled resin, it’s an excellent choice for making hash and other concentrates that distill its psychoactivity as well as its herbal-berry goodness.  Blue Dream’s great taste along with its mellow and malleable effects make it a great strain to share with friends or to enjoy alone for some low-key introspection.\n\n"

        "description": "Grapefruit is the name applied to two distinct Sativa-dominant strains. The first is known as BC Grapefruit and the second as Nectar's Grapefruit. Both strains provide powerful uplifting feelings of euphoria and impart energy, with Nectar's Grapefruit often described as also exhilarating. Although their Sativa heritages produce similar effects, the strains differ in other ways. The Nectar's strain's effects tend to be more internal, often giving rise to deep thought, while BC Grapefruit causes users to feel more social and talkative. Both strains have common negative effects: dry mouth and eyes, dizziness, paranoia, and anxiety.\n\nThese strains can be good as daytime medication, especially for relieving stress and anxiety, though Nectar's may need to be relegated to times when users do not need to focus.  The cerebral effects are good for battling depression and some forms of insomnia. Patients may also find that Grapefruit makes their minor aches and pains more manageable. It is not recommended, however, for severe chronic aches and pains. More Indica-heavy strains are usually prescribed for that purpose (see strains most frequently prescribed for pain here.)\n\nBC Grapefruit comes from a clone of unknown genetics. Breeder Steve from Spice of Life found the clone, which had been labeled the one to grow. It gained some popularity in the 80s but was clone only. Other breeders have created seeds by back-crossing the strain. True BC Grapefruit has since become very scarce. The strains derived from BC Grapefruit carry a THC range of 15% -20% and grow well both outside and indoors. They flower for 55 to 60 days.\n\nNectar's Grapefruit is a cross between C99/Cinderella 99 and an unknown landrace Sativa devised by Nectar Seeds. Like BC Grapefruit, it can grow both indoors and outside but has a longer flowering time of 60 to 69 days.\n\n"

People typically feel a very light and dreamy body high with waves of uplifting mood and euphoria, accompanied by increased levels of energy and creativity. The effects can last up to 90 minutes. Side effects include dry mouth and eyes, paranoia, headaches, and dizziness.\n\nThis strain is great for daytime use. It works well to help patients cope with stress, anxiety, and depression. It is also helpful for treating mild but chronic ache and pains and migraines. Cinderella 99 eases inflammation, increases appetite, and combats nausea. It is an energy booster for people suffering from fatigue.\n\nThrough a long process of back-crossing over three generations, Cinderella 99 was created by Mr. Soul of the Brothers Grimm. The result is a cross between Princess and Cinderella 88, which was bred specifically for indoor setups. The strain is rather short for a Sativa and rarely grows over 100 centimeters. Growing well in hydroponics, Cinderella 99 can reportedly produce up to two pounds per square meter (or 1,000 watts). Recommended for moderately-experienced growers, this strain finishes flowering in about fifty days.\n\n"

        "description": "Nebula, sometimes called Starcloud, is an award winning hybrid strain known for its strong effects, delivered with a sweet honey flavor. Paradise Seeds first designed Nebula in 1996, and it is reportedly a cross between a US Haze and Master Widow.\n\nThis strain is capable of affecting both body and mind. The most consistently reported effects are an intensely energizing psychedelic state and a state of euphoric happiness.\n\nSome users feel creative and focused, while others find Nebula meditative and thought-provoking. Its milder Indica effects may stimulate appetite, calm the body, and cause inexperienced users to feel tired or lazy. While the positive effects of this strain can be stellar, negative effects are still present and may include cotton mouth, dry eyes, dizziness, paranoia, and anxiety.\n\nFor most, this strain can be used any time of day though because of its psychedelic and euphoric effects, it is more appropriate for times when work need not be done. Nebula's cerebral effects make it ideal for relieving stress, anxiety, and depression. It may be prescribed for mild to moderate aches and pains as well as nausea and eating disorders.\n\nThe strain grows well both indoors and out and does particularly well in a Sea of Green. Nebula requires at least nine weeks to finish flowering and can produce up to 500 grams when grown properly. To grow well outdoors, the strain needs a temperate climate.\n\n"

Like most Sativa strains, Jack Frost is fluffy and dry and has a delicate feel. The sweet citrus smell and woody taste make this an easy smoke for users looking for an uplifting euphoria or a medication for pain and anxiety.\n\nJack Frost is especially useful as a social strain because of its uplifting and euphoric effects. It is known for engendering happiness and periods of giggling. Medicinally, this citrus and musky tasting Sativa-dominant hybrid has proven helpful for the treatment of anxiety, loss of appetite, and stress. A high of up to three hours can be expected from about two average bong rips. Jack Frost is often recommended for active daytime use.\n\nThis mixed sub-species has a CB profile of THC 21.6%, CBD 0.3%, and CBN 0.50%. Indoors, the strain has a 55-60 day flower cycle. When grown outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere, the strain is ready to be harvested in September. Whether grown indoors or outdoors, the strain produces a heavy yield.\n\n"

        "description": "Legendary for its off-the-charts resin production, White Widow is a staple sativa-dominant hybrid with powerful energizing effects. It was produced by Dutch veterans Green House Seeds in the 1990s as a cross between Brazilian indica and South Indian sativa landraces. At the time, the underground cannabis market consisted mostly of early hybrids like Northern Lights and Haze, but White Widow has since joined the ranks of these legendary strains, winning an early High Times Cannabis Cup in 1995 and several awards since. Bred specifically for a high trichome count, White Widow is especially valued in the production of hash. This strain has an average THC composition of 20%, with some phenotypes exceeding that amount.\n\nBuds of White Widow are chunky and somewhat conical and tapered. The bud structure of the flowers are more sativa than indica, with a loose and fluffy texture that can be broken up somewhat easily despite its stickiness. The leaves are spring green with few visible pistils.\n\nWhen grown successfully, buds are entirely covered in long-stalked trichomes, lending the whitish-gray appearance that gives the strain its memorable name. White Widow is known for having a stinging, ammonia-like scent with some hints of earthy pine. Breaking buds open gives off a more hashy, incense-like odor. The smooth smoke tastes similarly earthy -- users accustomed to fruity or tasty crossbreeds may be disappointed by White Widow’s relative lack of flavor. That said, White Widow is especially pungent when combusted, so smokers worried about discretion should plan accordingly.\n\nWhat this strain lacks in flavor profile, it makes up for in quick-acting cerebral effects. Users can become more acutely perceptive of their surroundings, tuned into sounds and patterns that may have gone unnoticed before. Enthusiasts also describe an almost immediate uplift in mood and an energy and focus that can applied to either mundane tasks like cleaning or more complex problem-solving processes. White Widow can also be creatively valuable, inducing a kind of rapid-fire thought association that can open up some previously unexplored territory. Psychedelic effects like visual distortion and increased perception can amplify the impact of music or art, while a very mild body buzz mellows users out. Because of its deeply cerebral effects, this strain is typically more psychologically than physically helpful. It can aid those with attention deficit disorders in sustaining focus on a single topic. It can also boost energy in cases of fatigue or depression. Some users have even described White Widow as efficient in relieving migraines. Because of its potency, the introspective mind-race associated with White Widow can sometimes veer into paranoia, and smokers may want to plan dosage accordingly.\n\nWhite Widow can be grown from seed or from clone (achieved by planting clippings of mature and healthy plants). It is a mold-resistant strain, making outdoor cultivation an option -- although an almost Mediterranean climate with constant temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit works best. Despite a mostly sativa high, White Widow look much more indica during the vegetative stage: plants are bushy and wide, and rarely exceed 6 feet in height. The plants flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect about 37 to 55 grams (or about 1.3 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\nAs if the Dutch reputation for quality cannabis breeding hadn’t already been established with highly successful strains like Big Bud, White Widow shows off the excellent results of studied and deliberate cultivation in the Netherlands. The super-sticky strain provides a cerebral high that, while sometimes daunting in large doses, mostly allows users to remain functional and aware of their surroundings. An excellent choice for chatty social use, this strain is an all-purpose perennial favorite. Its strong genetic foundation -- it is crossed from Brazilian and South Asian landraces -- has made White Widow a valuable plant for experimentation in crossbreeding; among others, it has yielded increasingly popular hybrids like White Russian and The White.\n\n"

Not surprisingly, L.S.D. also has typical Indica-based body effects. Users often notice the powerful body numbing 1 to 2 hours after ingestion, once most of the cerebral effects wear off. The negative effects may include cotton mouth, dry eyes, dizziness, headaches, and minor paranoia.\n\nFor most, this strain can be used any time of day to ease mild to moderate chronic aches and pains. L.S.D. is often prescribed to help deal with stress, anxiety, or depression. Patients also use the strain to treat insomnia, and a few choose it to help combat migraines.\n\nL.S.D. is a cross between a Mazar and a very old variety of skunk, Skunk #1, created by Barney's Farm. While this strain is not recommended for new growers, it is quite easy to cultivate as it is resistant to many diseases and can be grown both outdoors and inside. With a long flowering period of between 65 and 78 days, L.S.D. can produce up to 650 grams per square meter. Rarely exceeding 60 centimeters, the strain usually finishes in April in the Southern hemisphere and October in the Northern. This strain can have a THC count of up to 24%.\n\n"

Many describe this strain as thought-provoking and creativity-inducing, and some find Lemon Skunk to be also exhilarating and energetic. Often, the numbing and calming effects of the body stone cause users to feel slightly sedated. Inexperienced users may find it puts them to sleep an hour or two after the initial cerebral stimulation wears off.

Those suffering from stress, anxiety, and depression favor this strain for its mood elevating properties. The strain is also used for the relief of nausea and eating disorders. \n\nLemon Skunk is designed by DNA Genetics, who chose two different strains of skunk with a strong flavor and scent of lemons as its parents. The mother is a skunk that originated from Vegas, while the father came from Holland. The strain grows easily and is suitable to growers with any experience level. It thrives both indoors and out. Needing 55 to 65 days to finish, the strain can reportedly produce up to 600 grams per square meter.

The THC concentration of this strain may be as high as 20%.\n\nThe effects of this strain are highly psychoactive, due to a high count of tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). It produces strong euphoria and gives spacey, happy, and slightly psychedelic sensations after only one or two hits. Some users feel creative and focused. The strong cerebral effects begin to diminish after about an hour, but the residual effects can last another two hours. These effects are coupled with pleasant body numbing sensations. Strong and trippy, this strain induces an insatiable appetite. This mega-strain may result in dry eyes and mouth and lead to paranoia, dizziness, and anxiety when consumed in high doses.\n\nMoby Dick is designed specifically as a strong medical strain. It is excellent for daytime use though patients may feel lazy a few hours after use. The cerebral effects are often used to combat the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Patients that have lost their appetites, whether it's due to chemotherapy or other reasons, often choose this strain. The body high may ease mild aches and pains, but it is not strong enough to combat severe pain.\n\nMoby Dick comes from the breeders at Dinafem (dinafem.org) who crossed two of their mother plants, a variety of Haze and a variety of White Widow. The strain has two phenotypes: one with Sativa-dominant characteristics that can reach up to twelve feet outdoors, while the other is a smaller, Indica-dominant phenotype, that is only seen about 35% of the time.\n\nMoby Dick can be grown indoors or outside and is not recommended for amateur growers. Inside, the strain flowers for around ten weeks and requires an electrical conductivity level between 1.5 and 2 as well as 800 watts per square meter. Growers are also cautioned to keep the pH levels below 6.5 as they can affect yield. Outside, this strain needs little care, and under optimal conditions it may produce exceptionally high yields.\n\n"

        "description": "Headband is an iconic indica hybrid that draws on some solid cannabis genetics to offer buds with visual “bag appeal” and a potent stoney high. Although the name Headband may conjure up images of hippies in decorative headgear, it actually refers to the sensation of pressure that builds up around the user’s temples as this strain’s THC dilates blood vessels in the face.\n\nHeadband is a cross between staple strains OG Kush, Master Kush, and Sour Diesel. All of these indica heavy hitters endow Headband with a high THC content -- it has been measured at between 20% and an impressive 27%. Some sources claim that Headband was developed by Colorado-based breeders Reserva Privada -- who are also responsible for tasty strains like Kandy Kush and Strawberry Banana. Still others attest to an origin in 707 Headband, a grassroots strain developed in the cannabis promised land of Humboldt County, California; breeders DNA Genetics claim to have studied this “707” strain and recreated its likely genetic profile to produce Headband.\n\nBuds of Headband are small and are more like nuggets than dense, spade-like cones. The leaves are an even, pale green, although some plant phenotypes have a higher propensity for shades of purple (the result of cold temperatures activating anthocyanin compounds during the vegetative period). As might be expected of a strain with such high THC, Headband flowers are covered in silvery-white trichomes and are sticky to the touch -- this is one strain that proves difficult to breakup for joints or pipes without using a grinder. The initial smell of the cured flowers is tangy and lemony. Underneath these dominant scents is a faint skunkiness, along with some notes of pine. Unlike some other indicas -- particularly OGs -- Headband produces smoke that is thick but surprisingly smooth. This smoke has a rounded, creamy mouthfeel and tastes citrusy when inhaled. On the exhale, a more diesel, chemical funk is present. The overall taste sensation is of lemon-scented cleaning fluid that hits the user at the front of the palate.\n\nThe high from Headband mounts slowly, with some users reporting that they may not notice effects for up to 20 minutes after consuming. With very little sativa effects, Headband induces a spacey, foggy state that makes it poorly suited to tasks that require focus and mental acuity. In addition to this fogginess, Headband gives users a physically weighty feeling that spreads down through the spine and radiates out to the limbs, comfortably locking them into supine position. This sense of couchlock makes Headband ideal for passive activities in comfortable surroundings, like watching movies or listening to music. It could also serve as inspiration for some general creative thinking. The psychedelic sense of disconnection from one’s own body makes Headband a potential aphrodisiac as well.\n\nMedically speaking, Headband’s powerful sedative properties serve as a remedy for mild anxiety and, in large enough doses, for chronic insomnia. Fans of the strain have also reported improvement in symptoms associated with migraines and muscle spasms. Headband has been known to provoke appetite, making it a supplementary treatment for users suffering from decreased hunger due to disease or chemotherapy. Negative side effects include a feeling of dizziness, drymouth, and -- thanks to the same expansion of blood vessels that causes this strain’s trademark facial pressure -- red eyes. The high from Headband is said to last longer than average, even in users with a relatively high tolerance for THC.\n\nPerhaps because of its sturdy genetic profile, Headband produces versatile plants that can be grown by those with limited to moderate experience. It is not as vulnerable as many other strains to mold or disease; it can also withstand some degree of temperature variation. This heartiness makes Headband a solid outdoor crop in warm temperate climates. Headband can also be easily grown indoors: its plants have a characteristic indica shape, with a shorter than average height and a bushy silhouette. In order to let light reach low-growing flowering nodes, growers should attempt to trim any broad fan leaves -- but they may not find many, due to this strain’s low leaf-to-bud ratio. Grown indoors, Headband flowers within 10 to 11 weeks. It produces higher than average yields. Finally, because it is so skunky and potent, growers of Headband may want to take some extra caution with plants -- isolating outdoor growing locations and installing odor control measures indoor growing environments.\n\nHeadband is a potent strain that will please cannabis novices and enthusiasts alike. Providing the best of what indicas have to offer, it’s a surefire path to relaxation, mild creativity, and an overall trippy good time, either alone or in the company of good friends. Although it has an appealing citrus flavor, this novelty doesn’t come at the expense of genetic stability or potency as with many new crossbreeds in the cannabis market today. Headband’s high trichome composition also makes it an easy choice for the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n\n"

Like many Sativa hybrids Trainwreck provides a very intense cerebral high with effects that are mood enhancing and euphoric.\n\nWhat makes Trainwreck different from many other hybrid strains is that it still displays most of its Indica effects as well - covering the body in a nice, warm, pain-numbing buzz.\n\nTrainwreck, when it is properly grown, retains the lazy couchlock feelings of an Indica and the cerebral stimulation of a Sativa, making it an extremely popular and sought after strain in cannabis dispensaries. Apart from the usual dryness of mouth and eyes, some users may experience paranoia, anxiety and dizziness.\n\nEven with its Indica effects in tact, Trainwreck still provides a mostly-Sativa high with ADHD, PTSD and stress most often listed as its top medical uses. Properly grown Trainwreck is also used to alleviate chronic joint aches and muscle stiffness. From many user's accounts only a few hits are needed to induce both the cerebral effects and a body high complete with couchlock.\n\nThis strain was supposedly the creation of two Californian brothers back in the late 1970s. It is a mix of three other strains Thai (Sativa), Mexican (Sativa) and Afghani (Indica). In its true form, Trainwreck is ninety percent Sativa and only ten percent Indica. As the story goes the two brothers had to pull their crop early because there was a nasty train wreck that happened near their grow site and they didn't want it discovered, thus the name.\n\nTrainwreck can grow well both indoors and outdoors. Plants of this strain grow fairly tall but the Indica in them causes them fill out well. Inside grown in hydro a single plant can yield up to 500 grams in a square meter. When grown in soil outside Trainwreck plants are ready for harvesting early October and can yield up to 700 grams. This strain flowers somewhere between eight and ten weeks.\n\nFor the longest time Trainwreck was only available in clone form but more recently a few places have been able to recreate seeds of the strain. There are several others that have tried to imitate the strain under the same name, some with great success. Real Trainwreck will have thin leaves and dense buds full of resin. The buds give off a strong citrus smell as they ripen.\n\n"

        "description": "Jack Herer is a strain named after a lifelong cannabis activist whose 1985 book The Emperor Wears No Clothes continues to be an influential resource in the fight for cannabis decriminalization and legalization. A sativa-dominant hybrid developed by Sensi Seeds in the 1980s or 90s, it is a tasty and perennially popular strain. Jack Herer has passed its genetics and part of its name on to crossbred strains like Jack the Ripper, Jack’s Cleaner, and Jack Skellington.\n\nAlthough the exact genetic formula is a guarded secret, Jack Herer is thought to be the product of sativa staple Haze and a cross of Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk. Sticky buds have an appealing orange-lemon scent and taste with just a hint of some dank pine. The high provides an excellent balance between cerebral and physical effects, leaving users deeply relaxed but attentive and conversant. Jack Herer’s appealing flavor and well-rounded effects has made it hugely popular with medical and recreational cannabis users alike; it has won nine Cannabis Cup titles. Cannabis lab Analytical 360 has measured Jack Herer flowers as having between 15% and 24% THC.\n\nJack Herer’s flowers are not particularly visually impressive: pale to medium green leaves form in densely-packed buds that are more elongated that rounded. The trichome count is high, making this a very sticky plant to handle. What Jack Herer lacks in visual appeal, though, it makes up for in scent. Cured properly, the flowers have a deep floral bouquet with hints of orange and lemon zest. Breaking open the dense buds shows off more of the citrus scent along with a peppery kick. When burnt, the flowers give off a surprisingly clean and herbal scent, similar to sage. The very smooth and easy smoke tastes similarly herbal. Although not overwhelmingly pungent, Jack Herer leaves behind a lingering spicy-floral odor giving the general impression of potpourri.\n\nThis strain acts quickly -- users are hit with a strong headrush that is noticeably more energizing than disorienting. As time progresses, or greater doses are consumed, this initial tingle spreads down the neck and through the limbs, creating a sense of relaxation without immobilizing. What follows is an alert and easily suggestible high marked by creativity. This is a particularly good strain for creative brainstorming and visualization. The sense of ease and creativity also makes Jack Herer great for facilitating conversation in social settings. Because it provides dual relaxation and buzz for the mind and body, Jack Herer typically leaves users feeling stimulated but in full lucid control of their actions. This mellow high is good for treating low-grade stress, anxiety, and depression. Users have also described relief from migraines. Although not high in CBD, Jack Herer can also be beneficial for chronic aches and pains. It is not recommended for those suffering from insomnia, as the stimulation of thought and mood can actually keep users awake. More of a daytime treat than an evening medication, Jack Herer could be considered an ideal “wake and bake” strain.\n\nSeeds of Jack Herer are available from the strain’s creator Sensi; alternatively, prospective growers can obtain mature clippings from healthy plants in order to grow clones. Sensi describes four distinct phenotypes of Jack Herer: two that lean indica and two that are predominantly sativa. Outdoor growers should plant in Mediterranean-like climates that maintain daily temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because plants can reach heights of 8 feet in certain conditions, indoor growers should be sure to curb the height of Jack Herer by topping and by flowering soon after the plants take root. Jack Herer typically has a lower than average yield. It flowers within a comparatively long 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid to late October.\n\nJack Herer’s well-rounded high makes it a great strain for cannabis newcomers. It’s uniquely social in its ability to facilitate conversation while allowing users to maintain a semblance of awareness. The rich, floral scent is bound to attract attention -- which may alternately be a conversation starter or a way to attract undue attention. Jack Herer is also a solid option for solo use, as it allows for creative thinking and a soaring sense of euphoria.\n\n"

In 2008, Ice Cream came in 2nd in the Hydro category, and in 2009, it placed 3rd in the Bio category.\n\nThe strain is 60% Indica and 40% Sativa. The high usually starts with the Sativa effects, generating uplifting moods with heady cerebral sensations. Users report feeling more creative. Adults diagnosed with ADD/ ADHD report feeling more focused. The Indica effects follow, often producing a numbing laziness, sedation and increased appetite. Negative effects include the usual dry eyes and mouth. Some anxiety, dizziness, and paranoia may also occur (especially with higher doses).\n\nPatients choose Ice Cream primarily for the treatment of stress. The strain allows patients with anxiety and depression-related disorders to relax. Ice Cream's Indica-based effects are also helpful to those seeking relief from mild aches and pains. Patients dealing with anorexia and other eating disorders may find Ice Cream useful in inducing appetite.\n\nIce Cream's exact genetics are unknown. When grown outdoors, this strain flowers at around 55 to 60 days and is usually ready for harvest in October. Indoors, Ice Cream grows best in the Sea of Green technique. It features an above average yield both indoors and out. More information about growing this strain can be found at King Green Buds.\n\n"

The buds of this strain have a bright orange color and possess a very earthy taste. It produces some euphoric cerebral effects, but the high is mostly Indica in nature. Users have reported an extremely powerful yet numbing body high. For this reason, Clockwork Orange is not recommended for anyone with a heart condition.\n\nThe strain's cerebral effect can be good for relieving stress, anxiety, and chronic depression. Primarily, Clockwork Orange is prescribed for people living with chronic aches and pain.\n\nClockwork Orange's genetics are a mystery. Matt Riot got it as a cut from a guy near Temecula, California, who supposedly told him two things. First, the plant was an experiment with colchicines. Second, it was a mutant from a pack of Alaskan Ice. While neither of these statements are confirmed, the original strain did have large leaves with a distinctive crinkle pattern.\n\nSeeds from this strain are rare. Riot only sells a specific number each year, causing the demand to remain quite high. It can be grown indoors or out but is not recommended for use with the Sea of Green technique as some of the seeds retain their mutant leaf trait. Clockwork Orange flowers between nine and eleven weeks, and it yields between 100 and 200 grams per square meter (or 1,000 watts).\n\n"

        "description": "Chemdawg is a legendary strain with an uncertain genetic history. While it is thought to be crossed from Thai and Nepalese sativa landraces by U.S. breeders, many have laid claim to this strain’s creation. Chemdawg’s origin stories include one account of a complicated seed exchange among fellow growers at a Grateful Dead concert and another tale pinning the strain’s parentage on a Colorado strain called Dog Bud (so named for its tendency to make the smoker roll over like a dog). Whatever its beginnings, Chemdawg has become a staple in the U.S. cannabis market for its unique taste and upbeat, energetic high. It has also been used to crossbreed several popular and successful strains. Chemdawg’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 20%.\n\nChemdawg has medium-sized buds that look slightly different from those of hybrid or pure indica lineage. Long and tapered rather than popcorn-like, the flowers have relatively loose and wispy leaves. The spring green leaves are covered in sticky white trichomes, lending buds a silver-white appearance. Due to the combination of their loose structure and resinous texture, buds of Chemdawg are particularly difficult to break up by hand -- users preparing flowers for joints or pipes will have an easier time with a grinder. The sticky flowers are threaded through with red to orange pistils. Chemdawg has a smell reminiscent of diesel fuel (which many say is the source of the “chem” in its name). The pungent flowers also give off odors of earthy musk and some pine. As long as flowers are properly cured, this strain has smooth smoke that tastes sour and when inhaled. On the exhale, Chemdawg’s smoke betrays its signature diesel taste with an ammonia-like tang that hits the top of the palate.\n\nThe high from Chemdawg hits quickly, sometimes before users have had a chance to finish appreciating its distinctive diesel aroma. Smokers may experience a sharpening of the senses and an increased hyper-awareness of their surroundings. This initially disorienting head high becomes more productively cerebral and introspective in the right set and setting. Chemdawg can lend itself to exuberant conversation. Its ability to amplify sensory experiences also makes it particularly good for creative endeavors. Many users report a palpable sense of physical relaxation -- although nothing near couchlock -- leading to some speculation that Chemdawg has some indica in its genetics as well. Chemdawg’s strong cerebral high has made it valuable in treating some of the symptoms associated with stress, anxiety, and even PTSD. Some fans of the strain describe relief from chronic pain and migraines as well. Because of its potency and mental focus, Chemdawg has the potential to trigger the kind of manic, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia. As such, even users with a high tolerance for THC are advised to moderate their intake accordingly.\n\nChemdawg is a strain whose cultivation is better suited to more experienced growers. For a while, it could only be grown as a clone if a clipping was obtained from a mature plant; now, however, many seed companies sell packaged seeds of Chemdawg. It is more often grown indoors than outdoors, as it requires a good amount of tending to resist mold and mildew. Growing indoors takes some vigilance -- the sativa-typical plants often grow over 5 feet tall, and as such, growers should bend and prune them early in the vegetative stage in order to keep them at a manageable height. Plants flower within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and typically offer a very high yield: growers can expect between 65 and 75 grams, or 2.3 and 2.6 ounces, per square footage of plant. Such high yields on such relatively tall plants can make for branches that sag under the weight of the flowers; growers should use tall supports like wooden dowels in order to keep plants upright in the flowering stage. Finally, because of Chemdawg’s pungency, any growers preoccupied with secrecy or discretion should invest in indoor odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.\n\nChemdawg’s potency has made it a valuable strain for crossbreeding. Its descendant strains include the phenotype Chemdawg 91 as well as the hugely popular hybrids Sour Diesel and OG Kush. More likely to keep users awake then put them to sleep if consumed at night, it has an almost eye-watering pungency and energizing and thought-stimulating effects. Chemdawg can be a great choice for accomplishing tasks, as well as for more celebratory circumstances as it keeps heads buzzing and conversation flowing.\n\n"

Unfortunately, those suffering from severe pain will likely find this strain to be of little help.\n\nBerry White, like other strains with similar genetic make-up, has been helpful to people suffering with muscle spasms and nervous ticks. However, Berry White is most often used to alleviate depression, stress, anxiety, nausea, chronic migraines, and low appetite.\n\nBerry White is a cross between DJ Short's Blueberry (Indica) and White Widow (Sativa). The exact genetics of this strain, however, are unknown. It is said to have a fruity smell that turns into a strong sour berry scent when the buds are broken up. Flowering can be expected in approximately 50 days. The strain is capable of producing 400 to 500 grams per square meter. Berry White can be grown indoors or out, and it is easy to care for as it grows a good ratio of calyx and leaves, which makes it an easy plant to trim.\n\n"

The strain retains its Indica heritage imparting a mild body high that can leave one stuck to the couch. Along with dry eyes and mouth, some users experience dizziness, paranoia, and minor headaches.\n\nThe strain is primarily used to increase appetite. Some people, however, use it for anxiety, stress, and/or insomnia relief. Due to its Indica properties, it also helps people with chronic pain. Because Black Widow induces feelings of laziness and sleepiness, it is recommended for evening use.\n\nBlack Widow is a dark deviation of its older sibling White Widow. Both are a mix of a Brazilian Sativa and a South-Indian Indica. Mr. Nice Seeds used selective breeding on White Widow to create a strain that is easy to grow and that produces high yields with a THC content of over twenty percent. The super-dense bright green buds are speckled with fine purple and orange-red hairs and frosted with trichomes.\n\nThe strain is best grown indoors or outside in a greenhouse since rainfall can greatly lower yields. It is naturally resistant to molds, mildew, and pests, which make it an ideal choice for amateur growers. When grown indoors, it requires eight to ten weeks to flower. Outdoors, in the northern hemisphere, Black Widow is ready to harvest at the end of September/early October, even when planted as late as June. Experienced growers can  harvest 350 to 450 grams per square meter indoors or 300 to 400 grams outside. While less experienced growers may yield less volume, those who wait until the end of the cycle will have frosted buds, which make it more than worth the effort. Males of this strain are great for cross-breeding with other strains.\n\n"

        "description": "Amnesia Haze has a somewhat misleading name: it's a sativa-dominant hybrid that, despite its potency, won't leave you with a severely impaired memory. Composed from a cross of staple strain Haze and several different worldwide landraces, including Thai, Hawaiian, and Afghani, Amnesia Haze may actually drive inspiration rather than forgetfulness. The Afghani indica in its genetics makes for a well-balanced, albeit somewhat cerebral high.\n\nAmnesia Haze that exists in the commercial market is mainly derived from two sources: First Medical Seed and Soma Seeds, the Amsterdam-based company responsible for creative strains like Lavender. The strain is a favorite for its uplifting vibes and its rich flavor. It won 1st place overall in the 2004 Cannabis Cup and Best Sativa in the 2012 Cannabis Cup. The THC content of Amnesia Haze ranges from about 20% to 25%.\n\nThis strain is distinguished by its chunky, dense flowers which show a synthesis of indica and sativa bud structures: although tightly-packed, the buds are more tapered and comical than round. Depending on how they're cured, buds will have a greenish to yellow tint. Rust-colored pistils, meant for the flowers to catch pollen from other male cannabis plants, stand out against the leaves. Phenotypes of Amnesia Haze can vary, with some playing host to more cloudy white trichomes than others; psychoactive potency can also vary in these cases. The unique size of the strain buds is matched by a unique scent and taste. The flowers immediately present a lemony tang that is mellowed out by some earthiness. Notes of wood, especially cedar, are evident in the buds. Breaking open the buds gives off a faint spicy scent, which may be familiar to fans of other strains in the Haze family. Despite all this richness, smoke is smooth when inhaled. The taste, both immediately and when exhaled, is again typical of Haze strains, with a spicy and citrus-infected flavor. This can be a pungent strain, and the smell of smoke may linger.\n\nAmnesia Haze has many of the great qualities that mark both indica and sativa varieties, although users may land on the more thoughtful (or even hyper-thoughthful) end of that spectrum. The high comes up almost immediately, inducing cerebral thinking and a sudden acute awareness of surroundings. In a positive set and setting, this mental sharpening can lead to a euphoric state of mind. Users may feel an improvement in mood as well as an energy to accomplish tasks. Although cerebral, Amnesia Haze also has enough of an indica backbone to also provide relaxation and contemplativeness. The combination of strong mental and physical effects makes this strain a good choice for activities that involve both mind and body, including but not limited to exercise and sex. More medically speaking, Amnesia Haze's sense of focus can be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders who have trouble concentrating on specific tasks. It can also be a strong appetite stimulant. On the negative side, those prone to anxiety may experience some degree of paranoia due to Amnesia Haze's tendency to bring on a sense of frantic mind-race; as such, cannabis newcomers may want to temper initial dosage of this strain. This variety's strong high also tends to last longer than average.\n\nGrown outdoors, Amnesia Haze requires a predominantly hot climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It can easily be grown indoors, however, as plants are more typical of indica varieties -- limbs reach more horizontally than vertically, with a bushy stature that doesn't usually exceed more than 3 or 4 feet. Growers should trim broad fan leaves at the top of the plant in order to let air and light reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Amnesia Haze takes an extremely long time to mature: plants flower within 10 to 12 weeks, making this a tough strain for commercial growers to cultivate for profit. As such, it may be difficult to find in the cannabis retail market. Personal growers can raise Amnesia Haze plants from seed or from clippings taken to produce clones. The very long flowering time rewards growers with trichomes and with 60 grams or 2 ounces per square foot of plant.\n\nDespite its relative rarity, Amnesia Haze is a popular strain in areas where cannabis is openly cultivated. Its even, well-balanced high is versatile for both mellow and more boisterous use. In particular, it can leave users chatty, making it a good addition to social situations. Alternatively, Amnesia Haze is a good choice for focusing on work in an isolated setting. Its energizing high is more likely to leave you wired than sleepy, so smoking shortly before bedtime is not recommended. Instead, Amnesia Haze's high and comforting earthy taste is just the thing for spending a cold day indoors.\n\n"

        "description": "Made famous by the James Franco and Seth Rogen stoner comedy of the same name, Pineapple Express is a popular sativa-leaning hybrid. Contrary to its depiction in film as a government-created experimental drug with military applications, Pineapple Express is a cross between landrace sativa Hawaiian and hybrid Trainwreck, which is itself a cross between far-flung landraces from Mexico, Thailand, and Afghanistan. Although there’s no consensus on whether or not the Pineapple Express strain lent the 2008 movie its name or vice versa, there’s no doubting the appeal of this well-balanced hybrid. Its THC content can clock in anywhere between 15% and a staggering 26%; certain phenotypes also contain small amounts of the pain-relieving cannabinoid CBD.\n\nPineapple Express has thick and lumpy buds that show off the strain’s hybridized genetics: they are densely packed like indica flowers, but have the long and tapered shape characteristic of many sativa varieties. The deep green leaves are sometimes tinged with shades of red (the result of pigments activated by cold weather during the grow process) and are accented by deep orange to red pistils. This is a very resinous strain, and the sticky flowers can be very hard to break up without a grinder; the residue left behind may be difficult to clean off of surface and fingertips. The predominant smell of Pineapple Express flowers is, unsurprisingly, pineapple -- but there are other, less tropical scents present like a hint of musk and some dank earthiness.\n\nWhen inhaled, the smooth smoke from this strain tastes earthy and a little bit piney. On the exhale, users will detect a sugary sweetness that lingers in the mouth, although not unpleasantly.\n\nPineapple Express offers what can be described as a creeper of a high -- smokers may have long since finished savoring the smoke’s unique taste before they notice the effects. They begin in the head, with a change in perception. Many have reported some initial psychedelic distortions like a sharpened focus on colors and sounds. As such, Pineapple Express can be a great strain to accompany a scenic walk. This alert head high is soon accompanied by a tingling relaxation in the extremities that helps users feel at ease, whatever their surroundings. The combination of cerebral focus and mellow relaxation makes Pineapple Express a versatile strain, good for chatty get-togethers or getting through a to-do list. Medically, this strain’s feeling of mental calm can be very effective in treating mood and anxiety disorders, helping patients to be more fully present and energetic. And although this strain isn’t as good as some more indica-dominant hybrids in treating physical pain, its head high can actually be useful in distraction users from the acute perception of chronic pain. The high from Pineapple Express is said to last longer than usual, providing a more economically efficient high for many consumers.\n\nPineapple Express can be cultivated from clone clippings, but due to its wide name recognition, many companies have made packaged seeds available online. Depending on phenotypes, plants can be relatively short and bushy or slightly taller and spindly, making them as easily grown indoors as out. Success outdoor cultivation requires a climate as close to tropical as possible, with consistently warm and semi-humid conditions. Pineapple Express plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October when grown outdoors and within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors. This strain has a moderate yield -- growers can expect about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square foot of plant. This is also an especially pungent strain in both the vegetative and flowering stages, so growers concerned with maintaining discretion should put odor control measures in place, like ionized and carbon air filters or exhaust fans.\n\nAlthough Pineapple Express may not be as overpowering as the eponymous movie implies -- it won’t turn you into a rambling, beat-boxing Bill Hader -- it’s an excellent middle-of-the-road strain for daytime or nighttime use. With its pleasant fruity smell and its upbeat, chatty vibe -- to say nothing of its Hollywood credentials -- Pineapple Express is an especially good strain in lively social settings, where it can attract some friendly attention and serve as a great ice-breaker.\n\n"

This Sativa-dominant strain that was devised by the minds at BC Growers Association produces a powerfully soaring cerebral high that wraps the mind in a blanket of euphoria. For experienced users, the effects are generally described as positive, uplifting energy that spurs creativity.\n\nThe orange-like taste of this strain’s smoke may also, unfortunately, bring about cotton mouth and dry eyes for most novice users. Some who use this strain may also feel light-headed and report feeling “the spins” – an unwanted effect that leaves the user feeling as if the room is spinning. The usual feeling of paranoia that exists with many Sativa strains may also occur when using higher doses.\n\nThough some find the strain makes them feel more anxious, many more instead find relief from chronic stress, anxiety and nervousness typically brought on by depression-related disorders or PTSD. Orange Crush’s ability to increase the production of dopamine, the chemical that causes one to feel happy, is used to help fight off the effects of chronic depression.\n\nThe strain is also used to quite literally take people’s minds off of their chronic pain. Those who suffer from nausea and migraines also choose this to help manage their level of discomfort.\n\nOrange Crush is a descendent of the legendary “Californian Orange” and “Blueberry.” This strain has the ability to thrive under low light (but not lower than 25 to 30 watts). Coupling that with the fact that this strain grows quite easily makes it a good choice for new growers on a tight budget and time schedule. Orange crush rarely breaks 140 centimeters and completes its flowering time in around 55 days.\n\n"

        "description": "Lemon Kush can describe a few different though similar strains. Prolific breeder Alien Genetics (creators of the popular indica Alien Kush) claims to have created one Lemon Kush strain by crossing Lemon G and Afghan Kush. Another, more common variety of Lemon Kush is the product of Master Kush and Lemon Joy. Cannabis testing lab Analytics 360 has measured strains labeled Lemon Kush at between 15% and 26% THC, making Lemon Kush a moderate to potent psychoactive agent.\n\nLemon Kush has buds that are nugget-like, and tend to be smaller than average. They hold a tight and dense bud structure, more typical of indica than sativa. Its leaves are light green, made to appear lighter by a heavy coating of trichomes. All this resin makes buds sticky, and difficult to break apart without a grinder. When buds are broken, however, they give off a sweet and smooth lemon scent. Intact buds also have Kush-like notes of dank earth and musk, balancing out the citrus profile. When smoked, Lemon Kush is notably harsh and expands within the lungs, often inducing coughing. The aftertaste is tangy and citrusy, but without the ammonia or diesel taste that comes with other lemon-inflected strains.\n\nD-Limonene is the chemical compound -- or terpene -- responsible for the lemony scent and taste of Lemon Kush. D-limonene occurs naturally in citrus fruits and is used industrially to enhance the fragrance of lotions and perfumes. This terpene may also have some tangible medical benefits -- in animals and test tube trials, d-limonene was found to have anti-inflammatory and even cancer-fighting properties (although these results were not replicated in a later test among women with breast cancer). D-limonene may also help to relieve acid reflux.\n\nThe high from Lemon Kush can creep up slowly, taking as long as 5 to 10 minutes before its effects are fully appreciated. An enhanced sense of cerebral focus is characteristic of this high. An increase in creativity and rapid free-association of thoughts is also common, making this a good strain for artistic endeavors or for simply appreciating music or a movie. These mental effects are more clearheaded than spacey, freeing the user up to go about errands or household chores like cleaning. An evenly balanced strain, Lemon Kush also has a bit of a body buzz, mellowing out the cerebral effects and reducing the likelihood of cannabis-induced anxiety or paranoia. Couchlock is not often reported, making Lemon Kush a strain that can be easily enjoyed during the daytime as well as at night. Physically, Lemon Kush has been said to provide relief from headaches and anxiety. Less desirable effects include the annoying feeling of cottonmouth.\n\nLemon Kush can be grown by newcomers to cannabis cultivation, although an indoor environment is recommended. Outdoors, plants will thrive in a warm, almost Mediterranean climate, but may have trouble in regions without consistent warmth and sunlight. Under high-watt bulbs indoors, plants grow between 4 and 6 feet tall and have a standard, bushy indica shape. Plants should be grown in organic soil and supplemented by nutrient treatments like humic acid, vitamin B, and various enzymes. Lemon Kush plants flower indoors at the 8 to 10 week mark; they are ready for harvest between late September and mid October when grown outdoors. Plants provide an average yield.\n\nDespite the ambiguity around its origins, Lemon Kush is a tasty and effective strain for those who want to appreciate the ideal effects of both indica and sativa varieties. Its cerebral focus and free-flowing creativity can be mood-altering as well as energizing and motivational. Its body stone allows for deep relaxation without the inconvenience of couchlock or apathy. Because of its unique citrus and peppery taste, Lemon Kush is also a good strain to share in social settings -- it makes for a special treat or a conversation starter.\n\n"

The taste is incredibly smooth, definitely one you'd hope for when seeking out a calming and numbing sensation.\n\nIt provides a heavy brain relaxation especially in the frontal lobe as well as behind the eyes. When inhaled, it starts to create a numbing effect that circulates throughout the entire body. With this relaxation comes the feeling of euphoria and some minor creativity stimulation. Medicinally, Tahoe OG has been proven useful for muscle pain and spasms, mood enhancement and as a powerful anti-anxiety aid. Tahoe OG lasts up to 3 hours and provides a relaxing feeling throughout the day.\n\nThis medium-width yet lanky plant is best harvested after approximately 70 days of flowering and yields a moderate to high crop.

More common negative effects are the standard dry mouth and eyes, dizziness, anxiety, and potentially paranoia (depending on the amount consumed).\n\n\n\nHashberry is often recommended for afternoon or evening use, though some prefer it strictly for night time use due to the sedating properties that develop an hour or two after use. Its calming effects are often sought after by those suffering from stress, anxiety, and depression. Hashberry is not useful for severe and/or chronic pains, but it may ease moderate aches and pains. Patients sometimes find it helpful in alleviating the fatiguing effects of insomnia.\n\n\n\nHashberry's lineage began with seeds from a sample bag given to Mandala Seeds by a hippie in Haight-Ashbury. They developed this unknown strain into the mother of Hashberry and crossed it with a male landrace hybrid. Known to be a vigorous strain that grows well anywhere and works well in a Sea of Green, Hashberry usually finishes flowering within nine weeks. As it requires very little attention, it is often recommended to beginner growers.\n\n\n"

        "description": "Amnesia is the name given to several strains, which cumulatively have won at least 18 awards. Amnesia has been officially recorded as the cross between Bubblegum and Super Silver Haze.\n\nUsage of Amnesia strains is often characterized by a loss of short-term memory, which is replaced by what is remembered as happy times. The strain can produce increased energy, which is generally followed by a light body tingling. Paranoia and dizziness may accompany the usual dry eyes and mouth as side effects.\n\nThe Amnesia strains are usually recommended for people dealing with emotional, anxiety and stress disorders as the Sativa-style high is good for mood lifting and stress relief. Amnesia is recommended for use during down times. This strain is also beneficial for individuals suffering from stress-related insomnia.\n\nFor many years, Amnesia was 'clone only' and offered by Hy-Pro. Almost all of the other Amnesia plants are descendants of this first one. Most Amnesia strains are Sativa dominant and require approximately 80 days to flower. Some Amnesia strains grow to 180 cm in height. Many of the strains are recommended for growing indoors, but some have been successfully grown outside as well. Amnesia strains have recorded THC counts of up to 20%.\n\n"

Despite its violent name, the strain imparts a very mellow feeling and can even leave one stuck in a state of \"couch lock\". It also leads to increased creativity. For the most part, however, AK-47 will leave you feeling uplifted, peaceful and euphoric. Many people enjoy using it while listening to music. Outside of dry mouth and eyes, the strain can also cause users to feel paranoid and sometimes dizzy. Some users also experience minor headaches.\n\nMany users take advantage of the strain's relaxing effect to relieve stress and anxiety. Others use it to take the edge off their chronic pains and aches. Insomniacs take 1-3 hits approximately an hour before bedtime to induce relaxation. They report an increase in the number of restful nights following this routine.\nThose suffering from bipolar disorder, depression and other mood disorders use this strain to help relax and regulate their mood. The strain is also used to increase appetite as well as ease nausea and vomiting.\nFour strains were used to create AK-47: Colombia (Sativa), Mexico (Sativa), Thai (Sativa) and Afghanistan (Indica). Genetically speaking, AK-47 is sixty-five percent Sativa and thirty-five percent Indica. Its THC levels stay close to average. Its CBDs and CBNs, however, can be as high as 1.5%.\nAK-47 is a strain with a strong lineage that may have begun in the post-war 1970s as the Thai and Afghanistan cross. However, AK-47 itself did not come into existence until 1992. The strain underwent a rework in 1999 so that plants could produce uniform seeds.\nAK-47 plants are fairly tall and wide with large calyxes. The buds are dark yellowish-green with lots of crystals (trichromes) and fine red hairs. Many choose to grow AK-47 indoors in either soil or hydro, but it can be grown outside in a mild climate. Ideally, temperatures should be kept below seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit. If grown at seventy-five degrees, the plants will produce the same yield, but the buds will open and become fluffy. The strain flowers for eight to nine weeks. If grown outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in the middle of October. Under reasonable conditions, AK-47 plants can yield between 350 and 500 grams per square meter.\n\n"

        "description": "OG Kush is a legendary strain with a name that has recognition even outside of the cannabis world. Despite its fame, though, its exact origins remain a mystery. Some claim that it’s a cross between staple Chemdawg and a hardy Hindu Kush landrace. It’s also possible that OG Kush emerged from undocumented bag seed as a distinct phenotype of some other existing strain. The meaning of its name is also disputed -- the “OG” has been alternately said to stand for: “original gangster,” connoting its status as an old-school building block strain; “ocean grown,” in reference to its origin along the California coast; and even “OverGrown.com,” a now-defunct website that served as a resource for countless cannabis growers.  One thing that’s not up for debate is OG Kush’s potency -- its THC composition has been consistently measured at between 20% and 25%.\n\nOG Kush has medium to large nugget-like buds that have a dense, indica-like structure. The leaves are yellowish green, although certain phenotypes can show traces of purple; the latter color is the result of anthocyanin pigments being activated by cold weather. Vibrant orange pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants, stand out against these colorful flowers.\n\nThe buds are covered in trichomes that lend them a silvery-white appearance and make them very sticky to the touch -- when prepping buds for a joint or a pipe, users may want to use a grinder. When properly cured, the buds have a earthy, musty scent that is accented by some citrusy brightness: the overall impression is of a hoppy craft beer. Burning or breaking open the buds offers more of a pine-like odor. Smoke from OG Kush is commonly harsh and cough-inducing; it may sting the sinuses and cause eyes to water. The smoke tastes hashy and spicy like a classic indica on the inhale and exhale. OG Kush’s pungent funk may linger for a while after a joint has been extinguished -- those looking to remain discreet about their smoking should take the proper precautions.\n\nThe high from OG Kush is more head-focused than physical. It starts with a sudden headrush that may lead users to feel more focused on their surroundings; sounds and colors may seem intensified. This alteration of the senses may soon give way to a general uplift in mood that progresses towards euphoria. The increase in focus is not as cerebral as with more pure sativas -- smokers will not suffer from a disorienting sense of rapid thought association or “mindrace.”  It’s a versatile smoke that lends itself to the user’s mood and mindset The combination of mental stimulation and improvement in mood makes this a uniquely social strain, good for parties and lively conversations. It’s also a great way to enhance activities that involve the body and mind, like video games, exercise, and even sex. OG Kush has medical application as a means to temporarily relieve anxiety and depression by helping users live in the moment. Its sense of focus can also be helpful for those suffering from attention deficit disorders. Some have reported relief from headaches and migraines with this strain as well. As with many sativa varieties, OG Kush has the potential to make users feel paranoid with higher doses.\n\nOG Kush can be grown indoors or outdoors. Outdoor cultivation requires consistent temperatures around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growing tends to be more convenient for many, as plants are typically short and bushy, growing between 2 and 3.5 feet tall. Topping -- trimming the broad fan leaves that grow towards the top of the plant -- can help light and air reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Plants of OG Kush flower within 9 weeks when grown indoors; growers can expect an average yield of about 45 grams or 1.6 ounces per square foot. This strain’s pungency also means that those looking to isolate the odors of their grow space should invest in measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.\n\nBecause of its mildly energizing and uplifting effects, OG Kush is a strain best enjoyed in the daytime or early evening. Its positive high can be enjoyed in festive social settings or alone, for accomplishing any variety of tasks. It also has the genetic stability to back up its popularity -- OG Kush has been a building block, yielding successful crossbreeds like Bubba Kush and also offering up some distinct phenotypes that have become popular strain in their own right, like Tahoe OG and Alpha OG.\n\n"

This euphoria is quickly followed by a heavy, lazy body high. Kandy Kush is an ideal strain for those suffering from eating disorders and nausea because it typically stimulates appetite and gives users the 'munchies.'\n\nRecommended for evening use, the strain is most frequently prescribed to combat insomnia and induce relaxation. The strain's Indica effects can ease mild to severe chronic aches and pains, and some find it helpful in coping with anxiety and mood disorders.\n\nKandy Kush was originally bred by DNA Genetics and is a cross of two famous strains, OG Kush (Indica) and Trainwreck (Sativa). The version of this strain that won The Western Slope Cannabis Crown, however, was grown by Rocky Mountain Remedies, the first legal marijuana dispensary in Northwestern Colorado.\n\nKandy Kush flowers from nine to ten weeks and can be grown indoors and out with reported yields of up to 500 grams per square meter (or 1,000 watts).\n\n"

Its high is typical of a classic stoner high - euphoric and giggly.\n\nA-Train also hits hard leaving you feeling famished but not too lazy to go for the food in your refrigerator. The couch-lock effect of this strain can be nearly overwhelming and cause some users to feel sleepy. It is a feel-good high that leaves one feeling happy even after the high fades. Some users report an increase in libido while using this strain. The downsides to A-Train are all fairly common - dry eyes and mouth with occasional bouts of paranoia and anxiety for some users.\n\nBecause one of the strain's first most pronounced effects is the munchies, A-Train is often used by people suffering from anorexia and nausea. Others use it for insomnia, opting to let the sleepy buzz overtake them for a restful night. People dealing with chronic minor aches and pains can benefit from the strain, but those with severe pain will likely pass on it. Due to the happy high, it is also used to help regulate anxiety and mood disorders such as depression. The strain is most often used for evening and night-time medicating.\n\nA-Train is half-Sativa and half-Indica. It is a mix of Arcata Trainwreck and Mazar-i-Sharif Afghan. The strain was started in Holland, and although it was bred with the intention of growing indoors, some have successfully grown A-Train outdoors. For indoor cultivation, one has to consider the choice between hydroponics and soil. Plants grown in hydro will have higher yields, but those grown in soil reportedly taste much better. In hydro, the plants can produce yields between 300 and 400 grams per square meter. In soil, they produce between 200 and 300 grams per square meter. A-Train plants grow wide and 120-140 centimeters tall. For this reason, they are best raised as multiple branching plants. The strain requires anywhere between 53 to 60 days to flower.\n\nFor growing this strain with hydroponics, TH Seeds recommends using Botanicare Pure Blend Pro and Liquid Karma to help ensure plants get their necessary enzymes. During peak flowering time, they also recommend you add Bud Swell for the best yield.\n\n"

        "description": "Perennially popular hybrid Girl Scout Cookies, also known as GSC, is a heavy hitter that gives users the best of both cerebral intensity and comfortable body melt. It originated on the West Coast as a cross between strong sativa Durban Poison and staple hybrid OG Kush. Although it’s a fairly even meld of its two potent parent strains, Girl Scout Cookies has a mellow high that leans more indica. Overall, it’s a versatile and balanced smoke with a THC content that ranges from 18% to 23% but has been tested as high as 28%.\n\nGirl Scout Cookies tends to have larger buds that are chunky and densely-packed. The tightly-curled leaves are a bright spring green, and some phenotypes carry streaks of purple. In any cannabis strain, purple hues are evidence of anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics that have been activated by cold temperatures during the vegetative stage. The colorful flowers are also marked by twisted orange pistils. With a very high resin content, buds are covered in white trichomes. They’re also very sticky and can be difficult to break up by hand. Girl Scout Cookies proves its bag appeal with a rich, complex scent -- immediately obvious is a citrus sweetness, undercut by a baseline of earthy musk. When burnt or broken open, however, the buds give off a more toasty, biscuity scent, perhaps explaining the origin of the strain’s name. Smoke tends to be very smooth on the inhale and on the exhale tastes sweet and vaguely herbal.\n\nGirl Scout Cookies comes on full-force: feelings of sudden giddiness are common, which can escalate into full-on euphoria. Users may feel increasingly chatty or disposed to socializing. There's also a trippy, psychedelic component to the high. Smokers may notice an enhanced sense of hearing -- or even of taste, with foods taking on a more dynamic flavor. A strong perception of time slowing down is also a commonly reported effect. Some relaxing physicality accompanies this head high; users may feel slightly heavier or more calm. And while Girl Scout Cookies won’t pin you down into an intractable state of couchlock, you may have more difficulty with tasks that require fine motor skills. This combination of easy-going effects on the mind and body means that Girl Scout Cookies has a wide range of medical applications. Its ability to elevate mood can make marijuana valuable to patients suffering from depression, while its sustained sense of focus and immediacy can help those who find themselves keyed-up by stress or anxiety. The strain’s thorough indica relaxation may also relieve patient’s aches and pains, whether incidental or chronic. Potent even for more experienced cannabis fans, Girl Scout Cookies’ balanced high often lasts longer than average.\n\nGirl Scout Cookies can be grown from packaged seed or from “clone clippings” taken from mature plants. Once the means are obtained, this strain could be considered a convenient crop for growers of all experience levels. Grown outdoors, the plants require consistently warm and humid daytime surroundings -- although the strain’s hardy genetics make it more resistant to adverse fluctuations in temperature. It can also be easily grown indoors, as the short and bushy plants take well to the “sea of green” technique. The thick and compact flowers may need external support from stakes in order to keep from drooping on their overburned branches. The plants flower typically within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Growers of Girl Scout Cookies can expect an average yield of about 2 ounces (or 56 grams) per plant. After the painstaking process of cultivation, growers should also be sure to properly cure their mature buds -- curing involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in an that maintains temperatures of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.\n\nThe innocence implied by this strain’s named has created some P.R. debacles -- in late 2016, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission banned the sale of Girl Scout Cookies and about 20 other strains like Candyland and Cinderella whose names could make them potentially attractive to children. This controversy hasn’t slowed down GSC’s meteoric popularity, though -- it’s a constant favorite in West Coast medical and recreational markets, valued for its stimulating and well-rounded high. Girl Scout Cookies has given us many other popular strains as well, turning out distinct phenotypes like Thin Mints and Platinum Cookies and unique crossbreeds like Animal Cookies.\n\n"

        "description": "“Dutch treat” -- the common practice of splitting a bill after a date -- isn’t nearly as fun as the cannabis strain of the same name. Dutch Treat (also known as Dutch Crunch) is an indica-heavy hybrid that was originally cultivated in the Pacific Northwest but is now very popular in Amsterdam. With minimal CBD around 1% and THC between 15% and 30%, this is a potent strain that offers some physical benefits alongside its psychoactivity. A good option for nighttime socializing or introspection, Dutch Treat’s potency earned it 3rd Best Sativa in the 2012 Southern California Cannabis Cup.\n\nThere is no clear provenance on the lineage of Dutch Treat. However, many sources point to Jordan of the Islands, an experienced breeder from Vancouver Island, as the point of origin. Jordan of the Islands grows several staple strains as well as innovative crossbreeds that retail at dispensaries throughout the Vancouver area.\n\nPopular staple strains Northern Lights (another heavy indica with an earthy flavor profile) and Haze (a bold sativa with similarly wispy buds) have been suggested as parents of Dutch Treat, but without advanced genetic testing, we can’t know for sure how Dutch Treat came to be.\n\nDespite its mysterious genetics, Dutch Treat has a clear “bag appeal’ that has made it attractive for innovative crossbreeding. One phenotype of the strain, Dutch Treat #5, has been used to create several other popular strains: combined with a Hawaiian sativa landrace, it’s yielded High Definition; combined with Super Silver Haze, it has produced Dutch Treat Haze; and when crossed with Electric Haze, it’s given us Electric Treat.\n\nDespite its indica dominance, Dutch Treats’ buds are more sativa in appearance: they’re tapered and conical rather than round, and their leaves are more wispy and soft than densely packed. The leaves themselves are a dark green with golden and yellow pistils underneath a thick coating of trichomes. Because of their high resin content and loose bud structure, buds of Dutch Treat may prove difficult to break apart for a pipe or a joint if you’re not using a grinder. The aroma of this strain, while pleasant, isn’t particularly memorable or pungent. Cured buds have a muted woodsy smell of cedar and pine accented by some nonspecific citrus sweetness. The smoke is surprisingly smooth and has the taste of herbs and more pine.\n\nFor consumers who would rather not handle implements like joints, pipes, or vaporizers, cannabis company Bhang produces a packaged vape pen loaded with 25% THC Dutch Treat concentrate oil; even when vaped, this strain retains its distinctly herbal and earthy taste and smell.\n\nThis strain hits the user quickly, with a euphoric head rush. Rather than cerebral stimulation, Dutch Treat brings emotional uplift that lends itself to sociability and some talkativeness. The head high soon gives way to a wash of physical relaxation. Those same initial cerebral effects might skew towards laziness or sleepiness as the high progresses. Users may experience some lethargy and, with higher doses, intractable couchlock. Aside from Dutch Treat’s ability to ease tension, the strain’s small amounts of CBD have been said to provide relief from chronic pain, nausea, and insomnia, as well as from mental afflictions like anxiety, PTSD, and attention deficit disorders. Common negative side effects include red, dry eyes and persistent dry mouth. Dutch Treat’s slowly creeping body high makes it better suited to nighttime use. Consuming a small amount will go a long way -- users have described the high as lasting up to two hours, pending individual tolerance.\n\nWhen grown indoors, Dutch Treat can be controlled through trimming and topping of fan leaves to remain relatively bushy, reaching heights of up to 5 feet. If grown outside in a warm, temperate climate, though, Dutch Treat can climb much higher; as plants shoot up, growers may need to use stakes to keep branches standing upright before they begin to flower. If growing outdoors, cultivators should plan on keeping plants in a climate that doesn’t waver beyond the ideal range of 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Dutch Treat has a higher than average yield: if grown successfully under ideal conditions, each plant can yield between 4 and 8 ounces of flower. Dutch Treat flowers within 6 to 8 weeks when cultivated indoors and as early as late September when grown outdoors.\n\nDutch Treat is a good strain for relaxing, but not necessarily for being productive or socializing -- its indica leanings qualify this as an evening to nighttime strain. Dutch Treat’s CBD content also makes it beneficial for medicating conditions involving chronic pain and digestion. Because of its tendency to grow tall if not properly managed, plants of this strain may prove difficult to cultivate for a novice grower.\n\n"

        "description": "Blue Cheese is a classic indica-dominant hybrid that delivers a memorable taste alongside a balanced high. Its distinctive name has more to do with its genetic lineage, a cross between the popular Blueberry and the UK-native strain Cheese, than its taste, which is surprisingly fruity.\n\nThe Blue Cheese name has more to do with its lineage than taste. Blue Cheese achieves its potency with an average THC composition of about 15% to 20%.\n\nBreeder Big Buddha Seeds, who perfected a phenotype of parent strain Cheese, is credited with introducing one variety of Blue Cheese to the cannabis market. The Netherlands-based operations Barney’s Farm and Royal Queen Seeds also produce and sell seeds for a distinct Blue Cheese variety.\n\nCured buds of Blue Cheese are large and have a very dense bud structure. The tightly-packed leaves are light to medium green and are threaded through with copper-colored hairs (which are actually pollen-collecting pistils). This is a very resinous strain, and flowers are correspondingly covered in sticky white trichomes. When fresh, Blue Cheese buds are difficult to break up by hand and typically require use of a grinder. This strain has “bag appeal” in the form of its pungent aroma, flowers primarily have a fruity, berry smell, inherited from parent strain Blueberry. Rounding out this sweetness is a tangy hint of cheese, which some have compared to musk or even rotten vegetables. When flowers are combusted, the smoke is thick and lung-expanding, and can induce some serious coughing for users who take a big enough hit. Once smokers get past this eye-watering, palate-tickling pungency, they’ll notice an entirely fruity blueberry taste on the exhale, absent of cheesy funk. However, this strain can leave a musty, hash-like aftertaste that lingers in the mouth long after smoke has been exhaled.\n\nThe high from this strain can creep up slowly -- without the initial headrush that’s associated with many cerebral sativa strains, this indica will gradually bring on a sense of physical relaxation and an altered way of thinking that may catch smokers by surprise. This mellow indica vibe is excellent for restfulness and de-stressing, but it won’t necessarily lead to incapacitating couchlock -- although couchlock is a possibility with larger and larger doses. Blue Cheese’s physical effects make it a good means of relief from minor aches and pains, as well as an aid to counteract insomnia. On the sativa side, Blue Cheese confers a mildly euphoric high that won’t leave users trapped in a cerebral loop of recursive thinking. As such, it’s a great option for treating anxiety, depression, and even some symptoms associated with PTSD. Its clearheaded and focused high is also beneficial for those with attention deficit disorders. Blue Cheese can also be a strong appetite stimulant, for better or worse. Less desirable effects may include dizziness and some paranoia if Blue Cheese is consumed in large enough doses. This strain is optimal for enjoyment from early evening to nighttime, as a way to unwind after the workday or as an after-dinner treat.\n\nBlue Cheese is a relatively easy strain to grow. Seeds are available from the aforementioned breeders; prospective growers can also obtain healthy clippings from mature plants to grow “clones.” The strain can be grown outdoors, but like most varieties of cannabis, requires a consistent source of sunlight and a constant temperature of between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor cultivation may be a more appealing option, as plants have a characteristically bushy indica shape, with strong horizontal branches. Blue Cheese has a high leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that growers should trim the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant in order to allow light to reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. This strain flowers within 8 to 10 weeks indoors and is ready for harvest by late September when grown outdoors. It is a heavy yielder, with large flowers clustered around the terminal cola as well as the lateral branches; growers can expect about 500 to 600 grams (or about 1 to 1.3 pounds) per square meter of plant. As noted, Blue Cheese is also famously pungent, so if discretion is a primary concern, growers should isolate outdoor plants and invest in odor control measures for indoor plants like carbon filters.\n\nMore common on the West Coast than other areas of the U.S., Blue Cheese is a pleasantly balanced strain that achieves equally potent effects on the body and mind. It’s well-suited to mindless post-work or weekend unwinding, as well as to tasks or errands that have to be performed during the day. The sense of uplift makes it a popular option for social gatherings as well. With such qualities to recommend it, Blue Cheese is unlikely to be as polarizing as its dairy counterpart. Don’t be fooled, though -- this is one strain of cannabis whose smell is unlikely to fly under the radar.\n\n"

Well loved by many for the fruity aroma and taste that is coupled with a rather mellow Indica style high. Quickly creeping in is a sense of euphoria that, while not often leading to couch-lock, will usually leave a user feeling a little lazy, perhaps even sleepy.\n\nThis strain is great for relaxation as the other cerebral effects follow, uplifting users and making them feel happy. The body high that accompanies these effects is mild in comparison to some pure Indicas but still numbingly potent, as is Skywalker's munchies effect. Unfortunately this strain is not deprived of the usual negative effects; dry eyes and mouth, dizziness, paranoia and headaches.\n\nWhile not everyone feels dragged down to the depths of sleep by the use of Skywalker, responsible first-time users should leave this strain to evening or night time use. It is often the choice of medication for those who sufferer from stress, anxiety and insomnia. Skywalker is not recommended for severe or intense pain but may lessen the effects of milder aches and pains. The strain is also used to induce appetite, fight depression and alleviate nausea.\n\nSkywalker is bred by Dutch Passion, being a cross between a Mazar and a Blueberry. This strain is relatively easy to grow and can be grown by new growers. Flowering for between eight and nine weeks; this strain should be grown indoors. If grown in the most optimal conditions, plants may yield up to 400 grams per square meter.\n\n"

Most feel high instantaneously with cerebral effects starting right after the first hit that lifts spirits and fills users with a sense of euphoria. Soon afterwards most feel a strong body high that relaxes muscles. These effects are often accompanied with a lazy haze that can make it hard to focus. Some also find the strain can make them feel very tired. Users should be wary of the common side effects; dry eyes and mouth, dizziness, paranoia and headaches.\n\nOften the choice for those looking to alleviate their chronic aches and pains, many find this strain can make even severe pain manageable. Recommended for afternoon, evening and night time use Sensi Star may be used to reduce stress, the sleepless nights of insomnia, anxiety and depression. Some use it to generate an appetite or to fight the effects of migraines, headaches and glaucoma.\n\nSensi Star was created by the crew at Paradise Seeds and they have not released the full truth of this strain's genetics. They have stated that it is mostly Afghani Indica but the strain most definitely contains some Sativa in her lineage (we estimate it at 35 percent). Growing well in the Sea of Green technique; Sensi Star flowers for about seven weeks. Indoor this strain can yield up to 450 grams per plant, though reportedly it can produce up to three and a half pounds when grown properly. It does well when grown with a hydroponics setup. Sensi Star usually tops out at a height of six feet.\n\n"

This mostly Indica strain gained popularity in coffee shops there as a unique tetraploid strain. Most cannabis strains are diploid. They have two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent in each cell. Tetraploid strains carry four times the number of haploid chromosomes, making eight sets.\n\nThe strain has won several awards over the years.  It won The Cannabis Cup, known as the Superbowl of pot, twice - once in 1992 and again in 1993. It is also the strain of choice for none other than Snoop Lion (Snoop Dog).\n\nMaster Kush produces strong, but not overwhelming, euphoria that can leave users in a blissful haze. More experienced users report a rise in creativity and intellectual curiosity.\n\nNegative effects may include the usual dry eyes and mouth when Master Kush is smoked. Some patients also experience dizziness, paranoia, and anxiety with higher doses or when Master Kush is consumed as an edible.\n\nThis strain's main use is for relieving stress and anxiety. The strong, Indica-based effects are ideal for relaxing in the evening. Master Kush is extremely effective in the treatment of insomnia. Its body-numbing high can help manage chronic pain. The strong, stereotypical 'munchies' produced by this strain may also be useful in stimulating appetite for patients suffering from eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. \n\nMaster Kush is bred by Nirvana and is a cross between a true Hindu Kush and a Skunk. The strain flowers for around 63 to 70 days. Master Kush grows best indoors or in a greenhouse, where it can produce up to 200 grams per plant.\n\nSince the arrival of Master Kush, other strains have also taken up this name.

        "description": "Purple Kush is a pure indica that sets itself apart from other indica hybrids with its eye-catching colors and pleasant taste. It was originally created by breeders in a neighborhood of Oakland, California dubbed Oaksterdam, one of the oldest legal medical marijuana areas of the United States. Purple Kush is a cross between two South-Central Asian indica landraces: Hindu Kush, from the mountainous Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and a purple-tinged variety of Afghani. With 100% indica genetics, it provides a slow and relaxing full body stone. Named a Top 10 Kush Strain by High Times magazine in 2016, Purple Kush has THC composition ranging from 17% to as much as 27%.\n\nThis strain has medium sized, popcorn-like flowers when cured, with a very dense, heavy bud structure. Depending on the phenotype, leaves can be equal parts green and purple. The tendency towards purple, selectively bred from the Purple Afghani parent strain, comes about when the plant’s anthocyanins -- pigments similar to chlorophyll -- are activated in cold growing conditions. This process is similar to the breakdown of chlorophyll and the stimulation of red and yellow pigments that causes foliage to change colors in autumn.\n\nAs with parent strain Afghani, Purple Kush also has a very high capacity to create sticky resin, making it valuable in the production of hash and other concentrates. The tightly-curled flowers are covered in trichomes, giving the green and purple leaves a dewy white sheen. Orange pistils, intended to catch pollen from male plants, stand out against the already-colorful flowers.\n\nPurple Kush’s bag appeal isn’t only limited to visuals -- the buds also have a standout taste. The initial impression is similar to the odor of Afghani strains, with an earthy, almost sandalwood musk. Closer inspection brings out sweet and fruity notes of grape. When combusted, the flowers have a simultaneously fruity and hash-like odor and smoke, which can sting sinuses and bring about heavy coughing. On the exhale, smoke from Purple Kush has a sugary grape-like taste that may remind some of sweet dessert wine or purple cough syrup.\n\nUnlike some hybrids that start off with a disorienting head high that melts into a slow sense of calm, Purple Kush eases you straight into physical relaxation. Although there may be some mental effects, they have more of a psychedelic, distorted nature than a cerebral one. Smokers may appreciate the calming effects of music or of tactile surroundings. Rather than stimulate hyperactive thoughts and sharp focus, however, this strain is more likely to bring about a state of dopey contentedness. The perma-smile and heavy body stone that come with Purple Kush definitely call for nighttime enjoyment of this indica knockout. Purple Kush can also effective as a medication. Its powerfully sedative effects can blunt some symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can also be surprisingly effective in relieving pain -- both situational, like the aches that set in after a workout, or chronic, like the nerve-related pain that comes with cancer or fibromyalgia. In large enough doses, Purple Kush is also a great way to treat entrenched insomnia. The strain’s high is said to have an average duration of 2 to 3 hours.\n\nAs might be expected of a purely indica plant, Purple Kush grows low and bushy. Those looking to cultivate their own plants of the strain may have success outdoors or indoors, but may have more success indoors where they can control the growing conditions. Large numbers of plants can easily fit within a vertically-limited grow space, as they seldom exceed 3 feet in height. In order to bring out Purple Kush’s trademark purple hues for its full visual potential, growers may also want to shock the plants and activate the anthocyanins by exposing them to cold temperatures; however, growers should be sure to only take this step shortly before harvesting so as not to reduce the plant’s overall yield. Purple Kush plants flower within 8 weeks when grown indoors and in mid to late September when grown outdoors. Under ideal conditions, growers can expect a moderate yield of about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square footage of plant.\n\nFinally, those who have successfully harvested a crop of Purple Kush will want to properly cure their buds to preserve the colorful and tasty flowers -- all that’s required is hanging the buds upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.\n\nPurple Kush has the special distinction of being visually striking and boldly flavored without sacrificing genetic stability -- unlike many hybrids that are specifically crossbred for taste, this strain has roots that stick as closely as possible to the cannabis species’ origins in Asia. It’s no wonder the variety has spawned popular imitations like Las Vegas Purple Kush. An excellent evening smoke at the end of a long day or week, Purple Kush is uniquely mouth-watering and relaxing.\n\n"

The origins of the strain are rather sketchy, with some saying it was a landrace variety imported from Pakistan/Afghanistan in the 80's, to other claims by breeder Bubba which state the strain appeared quite by accident, even linking it's early days to hip hop group Cypress Hill.\n\n\n\nPre 98 Bubba Kush has a pungent citrus aroma wrapped up with a delicious Earthiness. Many users even find an aftertaste of coffee to be prevalent upon exhalation. While the smoke is a bit harsh and the taste of the strain isn't quite as pronounced as the scent suggests, it is still a great strain, especially for those who favor indica. \n\n\n\nThe medium hued green buds of Pre 98 Bubba Kush are well frosted with glistening trichome heads. Dashes of dark purple give the nuggets a haunting look when coupled with the generous frosting of crystals. \n\n\n\nThe effects of this smoke are considerably potent, so be advised that a deep relaxation will set in. This makes Pre 98 Bubba Kush great in the treatment of insomnia, the buds commonly lulling users into a deep sleep. It can also stave off feelings of anxiety or depression with the feelings of mood elevation it offers. The effects are long lasting, so it's also a good strain when used to alleviate pain ñ at the onset of a migraine a quick toke of Pre 98 Bubba Kush will certainly prove beneficial. Those who suffer symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Bipolar Disorder. \n\n\n\nFlowering time for this strain is generally right around 9 to 10 weeks, although some claim flowering time can be achieved in as soon as 7 weeks. Pre 98 Bubba Kush yields aren't quite as favorable as other strains, but the sticky, dense nugs will surely make the process worth it.\n\n\n"

Several users have expressed caution regarding its intake. Receiving more than a few hits can result in an overwhelming feeling of lethargy, making it difficult to move. The strain's negative effects include the usual dry mouth and eyes, occasional paranoia, and dizziness. A few people reported having headaches after using Afghan Kush.\nDue to the heavy Indica effects, it is most often used by insomniacs as a night time medication. It is also used to help people cope with stress and anxiety. People with eating disorders, such as anorexia, use it because of its effect on appetite. Thanks to its heavy body high, it is an ideal strain for pain relief, bringing relaxation to users with chronic pain.\nTraditionally, the strain was harvested  to produce a very potent hashish - the quality the strain retained. Due to the sturdy nature of this wild strain, it is recommended for amateur growers. Afghan Kush's unusually high THC content can make up for the lower yields beginners might harvest. It is fairly resistant to disease and molds (another big plus for beginners). Because of its natural hardiness, Afghan Kush can be grown both indoors and out. The strain flowers for seven to eight weeks and is ready for harvest in October when grown outside. Being an Indica, short Afghan Kush plants grow wide, filling out rather than up.

It is often prescribed for nighttime pain and inflammation relief. It is also regularly used to treat insomnia. The uplifting effects of King's Kush make it good for unwinding, alleviating stress and anxiety, and regulating mood disorders. Some patients use it to ease the effects of Parkinsonís disease and multiple sclerosis, while others choose it to fight nausea, vomiting, and anorexia.\n\nKing's Kush, created by Green House Seeds, is a cross between the much sought after OG Kush and Grape Ape. This 70% Indica hybrid can be grown successfully indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. Not recommended for beginners, this strain produces a moderate yield after flowering in about nine weeks.\n\n"

Named after the pungent odor that emanates from the bud, the strain has a strong smell that may dissuade some from trying it. In spite of the smell, however, Hog's Breath produces a delightful stone, featuring a powerful uplifting body high that carries no fatigue. Fortunately, the taste of the buds is much sweeter than the smell with an earthy and piney aftertaste. Common side effects include dry mouth and eyes, anxiety, paranoia, and headaches.\n\n\n\nA rare Indica that does not drag users down, Hog's Breath is a fantastic daytime medication, especially for those seeking relief from pain. It elevates mood and alleviates stress and anxiety.

The body high can bring on a powerful sleepiness that can easily overwhelm users. While all users experience dry eyes and mouth, some have paranoid feelings and headaches. A few users become dizzy while using Burmese Kush.\n\nThe strain is really recommended for evening and nighttime use only and as such also recommended to insomniacs. The body high can soothe the aches and pains of many ailments. Burmese Kush is also used by those that seek relief from their stress and anxiety disorders. Users that suffer from nausea and a loss of appetite can find reprieve and a need to feed from the 'munchies effect' as well.\n\nBurmese Kush was a hybrid of unknown genetic origin that came from Burma and wound up in the hands of TH Seeds. They decided to try to use the strain to make a perfect blend of cerebral and body effects. Crossing it with an OG Kush they are believed to have found exactly what they were looking for. Still the strain shows it's Indica nature in its short stature; reaching around 100 centimeters in height.\n\nGrowing Burmese Kush should be reserved for those who have had a good deal of experience as they can require a lot of attention. The strain can often have lower yields usually around 100 to 125 grams per square meter but some reports have stated harvests up to 400 grams per square meter. Burmese Kush plants flower around seven to eight weeks. The Sea of Grow method is most frequently used when growing this strain.\n\n"

        "description": "Bubba Kush is a heavy indica hybrid that enjoys very wide popularity. The strain’s original L.A. breeder claims that while one parent was an OG Kush plant, the other was an unnamed Northern Lights phenotype brought back from Mardi Gras in New Orleans; this unnamed mother strain affectionately came to be known as “Bubba,” and has since been lost. Prior to 1998, Bubba Kush was only available as a clone, but it has since been replicated so that its seeds could be packaged and sold. Bubba Kush is a classic indica with a solid sedative high that leaves users relaxed but still functional. It has a typically high THC content, ranging from 15% to 22%.\n\nBubba Kush has small to medium sized buds that have the dense bud structure characteristic of indica varieties. The leaves are dark green and can sometimes show shades of purple, the result of anthocyanin pigments having been activated by cold temperatures during the growing process. This is a very resinous strain -- a coating of white trichomes covers the colorful leaves, and are even visible on the inside when buds are broken open. The flowers have a vague aroma of coffee or cocoa, with some slight fruitiness beneath. When burnt, Bubba Kush smells more hashy and spicy, as might be expected of a Kush, with smoke that is fairly harsh and cough-inducing. Notably, this is one strain whose purple flowers do not result in a grape-like taste: the pigments that determine Bubba Kush’s color do not affect flavor. The taste is mostly dank, with some sweetness and a peppery kick in the exhale. This is also a particularly pungent strain -- users concerned about discretion should plan accordingly.\n\nUnusually for such an indica-heavy strain, Bubba Kush’s high begins with a warped, disoriented sensation in the head. This fogginess, however, gives way to a more expected body melt that intensifies as the high wears on. Although not necessarily energized, smokers can maintain mental focus and converse or perform tasks as needed. Mostly, users will experience heavy, slow-breathing relaxation and a palpable sense of physical comfort. Couchlock is uncommon, leaving users functional and alert.  Bubba Kush’s medical uses are mental as well as physical -- it can provide some relief from anxiety and depression in addition to soothing chronic, deep-seated aches and pains. In large enough doses, it can serve as treatment for insomnia as well. Many users describe increased appetite as a common side effect. Well-suited to nighttime or lazy daytime use, Bubba Kush’s stimulation of both body and mind makes it great for activities that involve both -- including, but not limited to, exercise and sex.\n\nBubba is a relatively easy to grow and is recommended for newcomers to cannabis cultivation.  Stocky and bushy like most other indica varieties, its plants can be grown indoors, outside, or in a greenhouse. Outdoors, the strain has the advantage of being naturally resistant to molds and other pests, but growers will have to ensure consistent sunlight and a constant daytime temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Bubba Kush grows well indoors in soil, but may have a higher yield if grown in hydroponic solution. The strain flowers between 8 and 9 weeks when gropwn  indoors and is ready for harvest outdoors in early October. Though the yield for the plants of this strain is typically lower -- from 32 to 35 grams (or 1 to 1.2 ounces) per square foot -- the quality of the flowers is very high. The dense buds are covered in sticky trichomes, making them valuable for curing and direct sale as well as for production of hash and other concentrates. Growers should be sure to properly cure the mature buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in a room with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 60-65% humidity.\n\nWith a healthy fan base and immediate name recognition, Bubba Kush is a staple of the U.S. cannabis market. Its potency and solid indica genetics have crossbred into a slew of child strains like Blackberry Kush, Bubba’s Gift, and Madness. Definitely more of a nighttime strain, this aromatic smoke and relaxing high can be a great way to unwind after a long day.\n\n"

Blackberry Kush is naturally resistant to molds and mildews but has been known to have trouble with botrytis. Measures should also be taken to protect it from spider mites. This strain is rarely topped and aggressive lateral branching is suggested for optimal flowering. Blackberry Kush matures around 65 to 75 days inside and 60 to 65 days outside.

        "description": "The aptly-named Big Bud is a predominantly indica hybrid that boasts huge, sticky flowers and a powerful body high. According to seed distributor Sensi, Bid Bud originated in the U.S. in the 1980s as a possible cross between early staple strains Afghani, Haze, and Northern Lights and spread quickly through the then-underground market. During the War on Drugs initiated by Richard Nixon and furthered by Ronald Reagan, intrepid fans of Big Bud transported the strain to the cannabis safe haven of the Netherlands, where it was nurtured and genetically stabilized. Fortunately, Big Bud has survived and has reclaimed popularity in the U.S. The strain won 1st prize in the “Mostly Indica” category in the second-ever High Times Cannabis Cup in 1989. The THC composition of Big Bud varies from about 15% to about 20%.\n\nCured flowers are huge by any standards of comparison -- the chunky buds are very resinous and adhere in large pieces, even when packaged in small quantities for sale. The spring green buds have fewer than average pistils, but hold a high volume of silver-white trichomes that make the buds look almost wet. Because of the high trichome count, these buds are also very sticky and invariably hard to break up by hand. The smell of the buds is just as bold, with a mostly dank and earthy scent undercut by some fruitiness. The Haze parent strain imparts some herbal spiciness as well. Notably, Big Bud has a genetic profile that’s similar to popular hybrid Jack Herer -- both have parents in the Haze and Skunk families -- but Big Bud has more grape taste compared to Jack Herer’s citrus. The smoke from Big Bud is smooth for an indica and finishes with a lingering sweet taste.\n\nBig Bud has a archetypally indica high with a very thick body stone. It can creep up on the user, sometimes taking several minutes to take hold. Users rarely report mental stimulation, instead describing a disorienting foggy feeling. Big Bud may also bring about some psychedelic symptoms like visual distortions and trippy time dilation. This lazy high, often descending into couchlock, is perfect for passive activities like watching movies or listening to your favorite music. The sense of relaxation that comes from Big Bud also has some medical benefits. It can ease aches and pains and more chronic pain conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its narcotic qualities are also obviously helpful for those struggling with sleep -- Big Bud can induce deep and lasting sleep that may even leave users groggy and disoriented the next morning. Because of the dopey high it brings about, Big Bud isn’t recommended for active daytime use or tasks that require a degree of concentration. It can be social in more low-key intimate contexts, and is easily enjoyed solo.\n\nBig Bud has height to match its outsized flowers -- plants can grow up to 7 feet tall. As such, it can be grown outdoors, but only in consistently warm climates with reliables sources of sunlight. Big Bud can be grown indoors as well, but because of its height requires early topping and bending in the vegetative stage to allow for more horizontal than vertical growth. The plant’s support system is robust as well: the thick central stalks can grow to almost 2 or 3 inches in diameter, allowing the lateral branches to hold up this strain’s famously hefty flowers, often without the need for supporting stakes. Big Bud flowers somewhat quickly for an indica, within 7 to 8 weeks, and has a medium-high yield. Plants can offer as much as 46 grams or about 1.5 ounces per square foot. Because of the size of Big Bud’s flowers, the curing process, which usually takes about a week in temperature-controlled and humidity-controlled environments, make take 10 days or longer; buds are cured when they’re dry to the touch, but not brittle.\n\nThis strain is a testament to the importance of expert horticulture -- without the care and attention of master cannabis growers, Big Bud may have been lost or diluted. Fortunately, the strain’s stabilization by Dutch cannabis enthusiasts has ensured its potency and continued popularity. A true knockout strain, a little bit of it goes a long way and those with a low tolerance should adjust dosage accordingly. Although not the best choice before going out and hitting the town, Big Bud is great for physically numbing and mentally soothing yourself in calm, comfortable conditions.\n\n"

        "description": "Grape Ape is a tasty, memorable strain with strong indica roots. Its distinctive look and complex fruity flavor makes it an easy favorite -- to say nothing of its incredibly potent body high. Grape Ape is the product of strains as different as Mendocino Purps, an award-winning Northern California crossbreed, the influential staple strain Skunk, and a legendary Afghani landrace. The combination of these nuances has yielded a bold and visually striking variety.\n\nThere are different varieties of Grape Ape, with seeds available from Washington State-based Apothecary Genetics and Barney’s Farm, the seed bank responsible for creating other taste-focused strains like LSD and Pineapple Chunk. Testing lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of Grape Ape at between 15% and 25% THC composition.\n\nGrape Ape is marked by standout colors and multi-layered scents -- this is strain with more consumer “bag appeal” than most. Buds are large and have a dense bud structure with tightly-curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a deep green, with certain phenotypes expressing shades of purple and even red, with copper-colored pistils throughout. Trichome count varies from moderate to high, leaving the flowers especially sticky. The multicolored leaves are also very pungent: a candy-like grape smell wafts from the chunky buds. Breaking open the sticky flowers with a grinder gives off a different odor, with some skunky musk from the Skunk #1 parent and more of a thick hash scent from Afghani. When inhaled though, the slightly harsh smoke from Grape Ape tastes more fruity than skunky -- notes of grape and berries predominate, leaving behind a sweet sensation at the top of the palate.\n\nNotably, the grape taste and purple flavor of Grape Ape aren’t necessarily correlated. Colorful leaves in cannabis are the result of pigments called anthocyanins activated by different conditions, like cooler temperatures. The tastes of different cannabis strains, on the other hand, are mostly determined by compounds called terpenes, and while many strains prone to producing purple leaves also have a combination of terpenes that create a grape-like flavor, not all purple strains taste like grape. In the case of Grape Ape, it may be the case that consumer-focused growers intentionally bring out purple hues for the added visual appeal.\n\nGrape Ape has a high that mounts slowly, eventually leading to a very weighty sensation in the head and limbs. Because of its slow onset, those enjoying Grape Ape should consume cautiously, keeping in mind that a little of this strain can go a long way. In ideal conditions, Grape Ape provides a palpable sense of both mental and physical relaxation, easing users into a spacey calmness. Rather than stimulating rapid-fire thoughts, Grape Ape offers a full body stone. Like the similarly simian-named hybrid Gorilla Glue, Grape Ape may leave you feeling like a clumsy, sleepy primate. Its indica strength makes Grape Ape a helpful strain for those suffering from nagging pain, whether due to temporary aches or more chronic conditions like fibromyalgia. It can also soothe sore muscles after strenuous exercise. Mentally, Grape Ape can melt stress and anxiety with the force of its foggy high. Definitely an after-dark strain, Grape Ape is great for inducing sleep.\n\nGrape Ape plants may be difficult for novices to cultivate. If grown outdoors, the strain tends to be resistant to both disease and destructive bugs. It can be easily grown indoors as well, given its indica shape: plants are bushy with strong lateral branches radiating from the central stem. Grape Ape plants rarely exceed 4 feet in height. Growers may want to practice topping, by trimming wide fan leaves at the top of the plant to allow light to reach lower branches. Grape Ape flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and produces a solid yield of medium to large flowers; growers can expect as much as 74 grams or about 2.5 oz of flower per square foot.\n\nJust as it’s difficult for novice growers to cultivate, Grape Ape may be a tough smoke for cannabis newbies: its gradual and powerful high can be disorienting, even to experienced smokers. Extremely popular on the West Coast, Grape Ape is an excellent strain for users who want to feel pleasantly knocked out or overpowered. The unique ability of Grape Ape to cause smokers to melt into their surroundings is best enjoyed at night - whether solo after a stressful day of work, or in an intimate gathering of familiar friends.\n\n"

Some users find this strain thought-provoking and nearly psychedelic. As nearly all strains with high THC content, this strain when consumed in higher quantities can produce dry mouth and eyes as well as some paranoia and anxiety.\n\nThis strain is most often reserved for evening or night-time use due to its sedating effect. For the same reason, it's good for insomniacs seeking a full night's rest. Critical Mass Indica body high may ease most chronic aches and pains as well as relieve stress and anxiety. Others choose this strain for migraines, nausea, and anorexia.\n\nCritical Mass is Mr. Nice's rework of an older set of genetics called Big Bud. The intention behind the rework was to create a stable strain with a massive yield and a very desirable high. It is a cross between a landrace Afghani Indica and Skunk #1. Despite being susceptible to molds and requiring support to grow properly, it is recommended to novice growers because of its yield and ability to grow indoors or out. Reported yields of up to 6 pounds make this strain ideal for cash-crop growers. The strain flowers between 6 and 8 weeks, and it grows well in the Sea of Green setup.\n\n"

To a lesser degree, it may help patients suffering from migraines, glaucoma, nausea, eating disorders and muscle spasms.\n\nBanana Kush is bred by Cali Kush. It is a cross between the widely known OG Kush mother and a Banana father. The result is a delicious strain that is 60% Indica with an 18-20% THC concentration. It is not recommended for amateur growers because it can require a great deal of attention. Banana Kush can be grown indoors or out. Having a lower yield than other strains, it flowers at about eight to nine weeks.

Snacks should be kept close as the “munchies effect” of Romulan is very strong even for experienced users. Everyone expects the cotton mouth and dry eyes but users might get caught off guard by the possible dizziness, paranoia and headaches when consuming Romulan in high doses or when baking it into edibles.\n\nThis strain is most often chosen by those dealing with insomnia and as such should not be used during the day.  Users seeking pain relief often find that Romulan may relieve even some of the worst chronic aches and pains. Others choose it to alleviate the effects of stress and anxiety disorders, depression and various stomach problems.\n\nRomulan’s exact origins and lineage are unknown, it was bought in 1996 by Federation Seeds as a completed strain. Federation Seeds was attempting to rescue the strain from dying out and received Romulan as clones. This made her entirely female and Federation crossed the strain with the award winning White Rhino.

Ruderalis has a rather low THC count but has certain growth traits that are desirable. Auto-flowering, the ability for a plant to flower without needing to change the lighting cycle, is one particular trait. This strain is extremely relaxing and calming, releasing the body from nearly any aches, pains or spasms. Often described as narcotic, this strain can be very potent and easily bring on sleep.\n\nWhen Royal Queen set out to create Quick One, they chose Lowryder #2 by the Joint Doctor, which led to it being among the fastest maturing strains of the time. Lowryder #2 genetics are a concoction that includes Northern Lights, Williams Wonder and a Mexican Ruderalis. In the end Quick One's genetics contain ten percent Sativa, 60 percent Indica and thirty percent Ruderalis. Though this strain can be grown outside, needing a mere eight to nine weeks to finish, it's height of 60 centimeters makes it an ideal indoor plant. Quick One's harvest is a little below average, most often yielding around 45 grams per plant, but it's ease of growth still makes it a favorite among some growers. The strain has a THC range of ten to twelve percent.\n\n"

That male Indica was crossed with a female Utopia Haze, which is another exotic plant that hails from Brazil and is a landrace Sativa. Breeding those two strains together, the people from Barney's Farm created a strain that at first energizes and uplifts users but then levels out, numbing out aches, pains and muscle spasms. Though many find this strain to be a pleasant experience, it can cause some users to fall into paranoia or to become very dizzy.\n\nDripping with the scent and taste of guava fruit, these green and red buds carry a THC count over 20 percent, some reports state up to twenty-three percent. Red Dragon is ready for harvest within ten weeks and can produce up to 500 grams per square meter if grown properly. While this strain can thrive outdoors in some climates, where it finishes in September, Barney's Farm recommends that it be grown indoors. This strain tops out at 80 centimeters, though most plants do not break past the 70 centimeter mark on a ruler.\n\n"

There was only one criteria they sought a male that would enhance the resin producing capabilities of the female. Already having a strain in mind, the Brothers Grim crossed their Princess derived female with a male White Widow from Greenhouse Seeds that reportedly had resin covered leaves. What came of this pairing is a strain that clears the mind and cause users to feel warm, tranquil and sociable. This strain almost never causes it's users to feel paranoid, making it a great strain from those that suffer from anxiety disorders.\n\nCapable of producing a moderate yield, somewhere between one and two pounds per square meter, Rosetta Stone delivers a THC range between 15 and 20 percent. This strain requires an indoor grow setup and may finish after seven weeks of flowering, though it may take up to eight to fully finish. Particularly suited for a Sea of Green this strain is fairly easy to grow but may not be the best choice for a grower's first time. Able to reach 120 centimeters in height, Rosetta Stone tends to produce one big cluster of large colas.\n\n"

Feminized seeds in theory then always flower as a female though if the plant is stressed it may end up pulling a gender swap on it's grower.

The hybrid style high may be used to calm anxiety, stress and chronic aches or pains, as well as induce hunger.\n\nGrowing well both indoors, where it tops out at one and a half meters, and out, Royal Cheese is not the smallest yielding strain. Topping out at around 45 grams per plant, this strain can produce up to 500 grams per square meter with only 600 watt lights. While growing, the stench of this plant is so strong that a carbon filter is needed for an indoor grow set up. The strain can be harvested as early as eight weeks for the best cheesy taste or growers may prefer to wait another two weeks for a more potent medication. Outside Royal Cheese may stretch up to two and a half meters and is ready to be harvested in the middle of October.\n\n"

The slight body high of Panama Red may help make some mild aches and pains more manageable. They may also help fight eating disorders such as anorexia. It may also be good for relieving users of inflammation and nausea.\n\nPanama Red is a pure landrace Sativa strain named after the country it came from and seeds are now really only available from the original breeder Reeferman. The decline of the strain's popularity is due to it's long flowering time that ranges between 11 and 12 weeks and it's moderate yield with a low THC count.

While the most often reported downside to Papaya is still cotton mouth, dizziness and headaches precede dry eyes which is then followed by anxiety.\n\nAs with many strains that carry potent Indica effects, this strain should be used later on in the afternoon or at night. The powerful body high that Papaya provides may numb out even the most severe of chronic aches and pains. It may provide sleep to the sleepless sufferers of insomnia. Also such effects may reduce nausea and increase appetite to overcome anorexia and other eating disorders. On the other hand, the cerebral effects may help reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nPapaya is the product of Nirvana Seeds and owes it's Indica effects to the pure landrace Afghani Indica in it's heritage. Nirvana bred the strain from K.C. Brains' Mango strain. The end result is a strain that can be grown by new and experienced growers with ease inside, outside or in a greenhouse. It is suitable for the Sea of Green method. For the best aroma and flavor Papaya should be grown outdoors. Flowering times for Papaya are short, it usually finishes within eight weeks and can produce up to 150 grams indoors or up to 800 grams at full height outside.\n\n"

That world famous strain was then crossed with the equally well known inbred Skunk #1, which consists of three landraces, an Afghanistan Indica, a Mexican Sativa and a Colombian Sativa. These two bonded to create a strain that both washes the mind in euphoria and numbs the body in tingling bliss, while tasting of sour fruits with a bit of sweet and spice mixed in.\n\nMr. Nice Seed's Shark Shock is a good choice for growers of nearly any experience level, capable of growing indoor and out, or in a greenhouse. The strain is not particularly picky, it can grow in hydro and soil but does not care to be fed to much or too often. It flowers for anywhere between 40 and 50 days, reaching a height of about four feet. Shark Shock can produce a heavy yield, as much as 600 grams per square meter by some reports. Outside this strain can reach up to nine feet tall and is ready for harvest late September or early October.

It needs between 60 and 65 days to finish creating a large harvest of up to 450 grams per square meter. Outside plants can yield up to 1,000 grams per plant. If growing the strain indoors, Mandala recommends using 400 to 600 watt high pressure sodium grow lamps. 8 Miles High can carry up to 23% THC.\n\n"

        "description": "Playing off the love many people have for the combination of sweet and sour tastes, TGA Subcool seeds crossed a female Black Cherry Soda with their Jack the Ripper strain to create Ace of Spades. Subcool believes Black Cherry Soda to be of Kush origin, but no one knows for sure just what the genetics include. Fortunately, the father's genetics are well known. It is a cross of Jacks Cleaner and Space Queen, which makes Ace of Spades mostly Indica. However, the effects of this strain often start out like a Sativa, causing users to feel uplifted and even giddy. The more typical Indica effects set in later. This smorgasbord of effects makes it a good medication for a wide range of both body and mind ailments.\n\nAce of Spades can grow both indoors and out, forming a tall, bushing-out plant. For growing this plant indoors, it's recommended to top it for height control. The strain does well in a Sea of Green setup. If using this method, plants should not be topped. Outside, the strain is ready for harvest in late September to early October. Inside, it needs eight to nine weeks to finish flowering. Ace of Spades will provide a large yield with up to 20% of THC.\n\n"

        "description": "Sensi Seeds created American Dream not only because of the analogy between growing cannabis and the flowering of the dreams of America's forefathers but also because of a comment made by one of the strain's developers. The comment was toward breeders who work with specific plants over long periods of time and who hope each generation would be more successful than the previous one. Sensi Seeds believed they achieved this ideal by mixing the genetics of an Afghanistan Indica, Skunk #1, a Jamaican Sativa, and a Hawaiian Sativa. American Dream is Indica dominant but provides a subtle cerebral effect with a calming body high. Because it is not overpowering, American Dream is useful for daytime pain relief.\n\nWhile capable of growing in sub-tropical climate outdoors, American Dream is most often grown indoors or in a greenhouse. Thanks to a large central cola and modest lateral branching, it is ideal for the Sea of Green method. Sensi Star says this strain needs 40 to 45 days to finish flowering. Once it does, the third reason behind the strain's name becomes obvious. When in full bloom, the strain is a perfect representation of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n"

        "description": "Not as sinister as its name implies, Diablo OG is a sativa-dominant hybrid that confers relaxation and mental stimulation. Different phenotypes of this strain have tested at between 15% and 20% THC; as a result, effects are mild to moderate but can become more potent as dosage is increased.\n\nThere is some ambiguity around this strain’s parentage. It is commonly thought to be a cross between an OG Kush parent and Diablo, a sativa hybrid created by Canadian seed company Next Generation; the Diablo parent strain (which won the long-running British Columbia Harvest Cup in 2002) is itself a cross between flavorful Blueberry, Grapefruit, and South African landrace strains, giving it the complex fruity flavor that is so evident in Diablo OG. Others claim that Diablo OG is simply a distinct phenotype of the OG Kush-descended Ghost OG; however, Diablo OG’s effects are generally more cerebral than the couchlock typically associated with Ghost and other OGs.\n\nThe creation of Diablo OG is often credited to Los Angeles-based dispensary Reseda Discount Caregivers. Reseda is also known for signature OG strains like Herijuana OG, a potent indica-dominant strain that is beneficial for insomnia relief.\n\nDiablo OG’s appealing taste and well-rounded high have made it a building block for crossbreeding -- Southern California’s Riot Seeds has crossed Diablo OG with powerful indica Sand Storm to produce the rare Diablo OG Kush Storm.\n\nWhen properly cured, healthy buds of Diablo OG are large and dark green. Some phenotypes show traces of purple, the result of high amounts of anthocyanin compounds in the leaves that turn purple when exposed to cold air. Brown to dark orange pistils are threaded through the dense Diablo OG buds. The flowers are covered in sticky crystalline trichomes -- this strain’s high resin content makes it a popular choice for the production of concentrates like shatter and butane hash oil. The smell of Diablo OG can be broadly categorized as both flowery and diesel-like; closer consideration yields notes of pine and citrus fruit. Diablo OG also retains the trademark OG hashy, munky undertones. The smoke is said to be smooth but lung expanding, and to taste sweet with hints of spice and pepper when exhaled. This is a very pungent strain and should be treated as such by both consumers and growers if discretion is a concern.\n\nIt may take some time before the effects of Diablo OG are fully appreciated: users report waiting up to 15 minutes to feel its well-balanced high. The predominant characteristics are a clearheaded sense of focus -- albeit without the intensity that can provoke paranoia and anxiety in some users -- and a thorough sense of physical relaxation, soothing chronic pain and sore muscles. Many users report some relief from acute anxiety and a renewed sense of perspective and clarity. This mental acuity has been compared to the soaring sativa effects that result from South African landrace strains -- lending further credence to the idea that Diablo OG is descended from the original Diablo strain. Unlike many other OG strains, Diablo OG is not particularly known for inducing incapacitating couchlock, and it can be enjoyed in tandem with activities that require some focus or mobility. One common complaint is pervasive drymouth, particularly when this strain is smoked in large quantities in rapid succession. Because of its even-handed effects, Diablo OG is appropriate at any time of day -- whether as a uplifting, motivating aid or a soothing bedtime medicine. Fortunately, this strain’s high is said to last longer than average.\n\nThis is a clone-only strain, meaning that prospective growers need to obtain viable clippings from a mature plant in order to cultivate Diablo OG. An outdoor growing environment should have a consistent temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the strain’s sativa dominance, Diablo OG plants are more indica in appearance; indoor growers will need enough space to accommodate bushy plants with strong horizontal branching. Plants that are successfully grown from clones should reach anywhere from 5 to 6 feet in height. Growers will want to practice topping, or trimming of the fan leaves towards the top of the plant’s central stalk to ensure that flowers on lower branches receive the maximum amount of light. Diablo OG plants typically flower between 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. The yield is moderate, although buds themselves are typically larger than average. Since this strain is also particularly pungent, growers cultivating indoors should make use of odor-control technology like carbon filters.\n\nDiablo OG is popular in California but is relatively difficult to find outside the West Coast. Its moderate THC content makes it a suitable strain for novice smokers, although it’s potent enough to keep cannabis enthusiasts afloat. Although its purple varieties have some “bag appeal”, Diablo OG’s real standout characteristic is its floral yet skunky smell and taste. A clear and mobile head high is matched by a mild but refreshing body high that makes Diablo OG a great choice whether you’re looking to boost your creativity, get things done, or just unwind at home.\n\n"

Even though no one knows the breeder or genetics of the strain, it was found in Oregon. Green Queen tends to be a creeper that sets on slow and mellow, relaxing the body and mind for a good night's rest. With the effect being more sedative-like this strain should be reserved for night time use.\n\nUnfortunately, Green Queen does not seem to be easily available to the world for growing and as such growing information is lacking. Those that have released grow journals tend to keep it inside and a few have had pest problems. Lab tests show that Green Queen can carry a THC count as high as 18 percent.\n\n"

        "description": "The dude abides. No longer just a novelty cocktail, White Russian is a potent hybrid strain that leans on some famous genetics. Originally produced by Dutch seed bank Serious Seeds, White Russian is a cross between sativa-dominant AK-47 and the notoriously potent sativa White Widow. These building blocks give White Russian a powerful and introspective head high. This strain won 1st place in the best overall category at the 1996 High Time Cannabis Cup, and it’s not hard to see why. With consistently high THC composition between 20 and 25%, White Russian is sure to make an impact on any who try it.\n\nBuds of White Russian tend to be small to medium in size. Their bud structure is more typical of sativa strains, with loosely-clustered, fluffy leaves. The leaves are pale green and, depending on the individual plant phenotype, may be moderately to thoroughly covered in frosty trichomes like parent strain White Widow. Cured properly, the flowers have an earthy, dank smell (imparted from White Widow, which is known more for its extreme stickiness than its taste profile) mixed with some sweet citrus fruit (passed on from AK-47, which has a sweet and floral aftertaste from the various Asian and South American landrace strains in its genetics). When combusted, flowers smell more skunky and slightly spicy. Some have described the smoke from White Russian as harsh and lung-expanding. Smoke tastes slightly spicy when exhaled.\n\nThe high from this strain takes hold almost immediately in the form of some initial disorientation and tightening around the temples. Users report feeling quickly energized and motivated, and being able to function with more clarity than confusion. As is characteristic of parent strain White Widow, White Russian has an intensely cerebral high that can lend itself to introspection, lateral thinking for problem solving, and creative inspiration. A sense of euphoria and emotional well-being can accompany this mental stimulation. Despite some indica in its genetics, this strain carries very little physical effects -- although, as with any variety of cannabis, heavy consumption can lead to couchlock and drowsiness. White Russian’s powerful head high makes it effective in treating anxiety and depression. It is also particularly beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Red, dry eyes are a common side effect, a result of the high THC in this strain dilating blood vessels and capillaries controlling blood flow to the eyes. Because of its cerebral intensity, White Russian also has the potential to veer into paranoid or anxious territory; users should consider their individual tolerance as well as their mindset and setting before enjoying this strain. More likely to leave you wired than lazy, White Russian is definitely a strain to be enjoyed during the daytime.\n\nPlants of White Russian may be user-friendly for even novices to grow; the strain’s hearty genetics mean that it is more resistant to adverse growing conditions and not as high-maintenance as many other strains. That said, growing this variety outdoors requires a consistently warm temperature and a direct albeit not overpowering source of sunlight. Plants are relatively short and bushy for a sativa-dominant variety, reaching between 3 and 4 feet tall when grown indoors. Plants also have a low leaf-to-flower ratio, meaning that cultivators won’t need to worry as much about trimming fan leaves during the vegetative state. Grown indoors, plants flower after 8 to 9 weeks. Outdoors, plants are ready for harvest in mid to late October.\n\nThis is a very pungent variety, even before plants begin to flower. As such, indoor growers may want to counteract the strain’s skunkiness with odor control measures like carbon filters or exhaust fans.\n\nThis bold cerebral strain provides some of the best of what sativa varieties have to offer. White Russian stimulates the mind while leaving the body relatively functional. This makes it ideal for complicated tasks involving problem solving or creative thinking -- for example, it would be an excellent choice to consume before playing cards with friends. Because of its tendency towards introspection, White Russian might be more easily enjoyed in privacy, or at least in familiar company and a comfortable setting. It’s more of a daytime smoke, but its energizing properties can also be used to ward off sleep, if necessary. Because of their high resin content, White Russian flowers are ideal for the production of hash, shatter, and other THC concentrates.\n\nNotably, White Russian’s creators Serious Seeds are committed to preserving the provenance and integrity of the strain: they assign a unique serial number to every bag of seeds they sell, allowing the cannabis to be tracked from initial production to point-of-sale in dispensaries. This accountability not only edges out impostors and inferior products, it also allows for the production transparency that is so necessary in today’s increasingly regulated legal cannabis market.  \n\n"

The father is the product of crossing a landrace Thai, Haze and Skunk #1 hybrid mother with one of his own pure Skunk #1 males. From this conglomeration comes a strain that produces a strong cerebral high that elevates moods. Wonder Woman is a strain often recommended for anxiety, depression and stress relief.\n\nWonder Woman can be grown inside or in a greenhouse but it has trouble with the great outdoors. This strain is not the easiest to grow and ends up typically being on the taller side, requiring a decent amount of space. Producing a larger than average yield, Wonder Woman needs about 10 weeks of flowering before she is ready for harvest. When grown in a greenhouse plants will be ready in late October or early November.\n\nThere is also another strain, released by Nirvana Seeds, that claims the name Wonder Woman. However, Nirvana has not released the genetics behind their Wonder Woman but some believe it to be descended from Ice.  Nirvana's Wonder Woman is an Indica dominant strain that produces a wide range of effects. These seeds are good for indoor or outdoor use and require nine to 11 weeks to flower. Capable of yielding up to 600 grams per square meter, Nirvana's Wonder Woman does well in a Sea of Green.\n\n"

Plants of this strain rarely ever break above a meter in height. It is often recommended that growers begin flowering when plants have four to seven internodes. Yumboldt needs a good 60 to 67 days to finish that business, after which plants can yield up to 350 grams per square meter. Buds from the harvest of Yumboldt can have a THC count as high as 20 percent.

Many users feel like they are quite literally wearing a headband.  The exact nature of the strain's origins have been lost. No one knows exactly where it came from or who first bred it, though some claim it came from The Breeders Lab. Still, that did not keep DNA Genetics breeders from taking a crack at figuring out 707 Headband's lineage.\n\nAfter a few rounds of tasting the full flavor of the strain and its effects, DNA Genetics came to the conclusion that the strain was probably a cross between OG Kush and Sour Diesel. Most places specifically list it as a cross between a female OG Kush and Sour Diesel hybrid that was crossed with a male Sour Diesel. However, those claiming it came from The Breeders Lab, list it as a cross between NYC Diesel, OG Kush and Master Kush. Often stated as needing anywhere between nine and eleven weeks to flower, this strain can have a THC count of up to 24%.\n\nDNA Genetics have since released a strain based on the genetics they claim 707 Headband has.

        "description": "Black Jack is a name applied to two closely-related strains. One strain was created by Sweet Seeds, and is a cross between two Sensi Seeds parents -- the mostly indica, Afghani landrace-derived Black Domina and the more balanced Jack Herer. The other Black Jack strain (sometimes spelled Blackjack) was created by Nirvana Seeds. This latter Blackjack is a cross between Black Domina and Jock Horror, Nirvana’s own spin on Jack Herer, which is sativa-dominant cross between staple strains Northern Lights, Skunk, and Haze. The THC composition of these Black Jacks cumulatively ranges between 15% and 25%.\n\nBlack Jack buds of the Nirvana variety tend to be smaller and popcorn-like, with pale green leaves and orange pistils that are covered in trichomes. The nugs of the Sweet Seeds variety on the other hand are larger and denser, sometimes with a purple tint to the leaves. Both varieties are very sticky and difficult to break up by hand. The high resin content of these strains makes them ideal for the production of hash and other THC concentrates. Both Black Jack strains smell and taste of wood and pine, but the Sweet Seeds type carries over the distinctive floral smell of its Jack Herer parent, with fresh grapefruit balanced out by some musk and tobacco. Nirvana's variety, while similar, may also have a hint of berries. The smoke from both Black Jack strains is often described as heavy, but smooth to inhale. Both taste sweets and slightly creamy or malted on the exhale.\n\nSweet Seeds' Black Jack has a high that strikes the user quickly, leading to a sense of heaviness in the head. As it progresses, the effects are generally uplifting, anxiety-reducing and depression-relieving. Users report a lasting sense of focus and motivation, although this energy can veer into jitters and paranoia depending on dosage and individual tolerance. Although there is a mild body high, this strain, like Jack Herer, strikes a very good balance between cerebral and physical effects. Sweet Seeds’ Black Jack is appropriate for daytime use for users looking to complement daily activities or possibly exercise routines.\n\nNirvana's Black Jack has many of these same properties, but coupled with a nice bodily effect, often described as relaxing. The strong pull of this strain may slow users down, but will not necessarily lead to immobilizing couchlock. The sense of physical relaxation can contribute to relief from chronic pain and can also be a remedy for insomnia. The mental effects of Nirvana’s Black Jack are often described as more psychedelic than cerebral -- visual distortions, strong time dilation, and a generally trippy sharpening of the senses may not be uncommon. Because of the possibility of couchlock and this strain’s other disorienting effects, it is recommended for evening or nighttime usage, as a social lubricant or an individual sleep aid.\n\nBoth the Sweet Seeds and Nirvana Black Jack varieties have a high that is thought to last much longer than average -- from 3 to 4 hours depending on dosage.\n\nEither strain of Black Jack can be grown by newcomers to cultivation with relative ease. Both strains can be grown indoors or out. Outdoors, they need consistent but dappled sunlight and a consistent ambient temperature of between 70 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. Indoor growing is convenient, as the plants of both strains tend more towards a bushy indica shape, with moderate height but strong lateral branching. With both strains, expect to see large spaces between the individual bud sites, or nodes, on the stems. Sweet Seeds' Black Jack flowers in just eight to nine weeks indoors. Nirvana's Blackjack, on the other hand, requires between nine and eleven weeks to flower. Because of their complex aromatic genetics, these strains can be very pungent towards the end of the flowering period, which may be a concern for growers looking to keep a low profile. Both have a typically high yield, and can produce up to 500 grams (or about 1 pound) of flowers per square meter. Both Sweet Seeds and Nirvana sell packaged seeds of their proprietary Black Jack varieties online; alternatively, either of these strains can be grown as clones by obtaining a clipping from a healthy, mature plant.\n\nIndependent of their producers or genetic differences, the Black Jack strains are unique in their boldness. Both are built on sturdy, time-tested strains that impart striking scent and flavor profiles. Both also offer a heavy, steady high that lasts longer than average, providing an economic benefit to the consumer. Depending on its lineage, Black Jack can be a welcome strain for the busy user trying to energize or lift their mood… or just a delicious treat for the user looking to unwind as the day ends.\n\n"

To create this strain, they crossed Grapefruit, a strain from British Columbia's Asian community, with a strain of unknown origin. A male from that cross was then crossed again with a Grapefruit mother, making Dynamite mostly Indica. Winning first place in 2005 for best overall strain at the Oregon Medical Cannabis Awards, Dynamite can produce a strong but not overwhelming sedative effect, accompanied by an elevation in mood. It can be very effective as daytime medication for pain relief, nausea, and anxiety.\n\nThe strain can be grown indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. Even beginner growers will get relatively good results. As it grows short and uniform, the strain can do very well in the Sea of Green method. Indoors, the strain needs between six and seven weeks to finish flowering. Outdoors, in the Northern hemisphere, it is ready for harvest in early October. Known for its heavy yields, when grown in the southern United States, this strain can produce up to one pound per plant.\n\n"

        "description": "True G-13, or Government Indica Strain 13, is a pure Indica strain that appeared sometime in the 70s or 80s. After years of crossbreeding, however, the current G-13s generally found in dispensaries are unlikely to be pure Indica. Today's G-13 strains are typically 70% Indica and 30% Sativa.\n\nG-13 produces a powerful body stone, typical of Indica strains, that will make users feel lazy and lethargic. It also has strong cerebral effects often described as euphoric. Experienced users claim this strain makes them more focused and creative before the couch-lock feeling sets in. The strain also possesses typical downsides associated with Indica strains high in THC, including dry mouth and eyes, dizziness, paranoia, and some anxiety.\n\nThe G-13 strain can be used to medicate throughout the later part of the day, easing chronic aches, pains, and muscle spasms. Its mood elevating effects may help battle stress, anxiety, and depression. Some find that it assists with insomnia. It is also used by patients to combat the effects of eating disorders, seizures, and nausea.\n\nG-13 is believed to have originated in a research facility in Mississippi in the 60s or 70s, where, with the help from the University of Mississippi, pure Afghani Indica clones were used to attempt the creation of a super Indica strain. As the story goes, Neville Schoenmaker convinced someone working there to bring him a cut from one of the strains, labeled G-1 to G-23. G-13 was chosen as the most stable. This strain flowers for six to eight weeks to produce a reportedly high yield and works very well in a Sea of Green. Unfortunately, true G-13 is a rare find as it is available in clone form only.\n\n"

While the breeder is unknown, it was listed in Oaksterdam University's 2011 clone catalog as being a \"Garden Rescue\" but no further information has surfaced. Some believe that the strain is an attempt to overcome G-13's main weak point, a lack of flavor that could really be called pleasurable. XJ-13 tastes of sweet and spice, with hints of pine and lime. This hybrid produces a body numbing buzz that comes packaged with mood elevation, clarity and attentiveness.\n\nAn ideal strain for patients to jump start their day, XJ-13 may provide good morning and daytime relief from pain, anxiety, stress and depression. It may be very effective medication for some insomniacs. The strain can also alleviate the effects of migraines, nausea and anorexia. This strain is very potent and patients should take caution when using it.\n\nThis strain is clone only, capable of being grown both indoors and out. XJ-13 tends to finish flowering right between eight and nine weeks. Many growers recommend vegetating the strain for a month and topping it at least once.

These patchwork genetics may account for the strain’s name -- “harlequin” originally referred to the brightly-patterned costumes of traditional Italian clowns of the same name. Harlequin is approximately 75% sativa, although it lacks the characteristically strong cerebral sativa high due to the mitigating presence of CBD. The standard ratio of CBD to THC in Harlequin is 5:2. Cannabis lab Analytics 360 has measured samples of this strain at between 4% to 10% THC  and 6% to 15% CBD. Harlequin has won multiple Cannabis Cup awards for its CBD content in both bud and concentrate form.\n\nHarlequin has tight, dense buds of medium size. Its leaves are medium green with pistils that vary in color from orange to vivid red. Despite lower than average concentrations of THC, Harlequin is typically covered in sticky white trichomes. When properly cured, the buds smell musky with traces of tropical fruit underneath. The combusted flowers have a woody, earthy scent and taste of mango and citrus fruits when inhaled. The smooth smoke is not known to induce coughing, and it finishes with a rich, hashy aftertaste.\n\nBecause its THC content is so low, and because its high CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of that THC, Harlequin is not likely to get the user particularly high. Any mental effects take the form of an uplift in mood, conferring a mellow mindset and allowing for some mild anxiety relief. Some users report an increased sense of focus or a shift in perspective, but just as frequently, they’re able to pull themselves out of this altered state and closer to sobriety.\n\nInstead of a potent high, Harlequin is known to offer pain relief from both mild and chronic conditions. It can alleviate the aches associated with joint pain and stiffness. It can also have powerful anti-inflammatory properties, making it beneficial as a medication for fibromyalgia and neuralgic pain. Additionally, Harlequin can relieve moderate nausea. This strain allows for sustained mental focus without a heavy body stone -- this makes it a versatile medicine that can be as easily used during the day or at night.\n\nHarlequin is a clone-only strain, meaning that in order to cultivate it, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from a mature plant. These clones are often available at cannabis conventions and expos, or could be obtained from a fellow grower. Although several digital seed companies purport to sell packaged seeds of Harlequin, such claims should be regarded with suspicion, as the strain’s growers claim to have never released seeds.\n\nHarlequin can be grown by newcomers or by those with significantly more cultivation experience. Outdoors, plants require a steady source of sunlight and temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. However, growers cultivating outdoors should watch out for environmental threats, as Harlequin is not particularly resistant to pests or to fungus. The strain is easily grown indoors, as its plants have a typically indica shape -- they are squat and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Harlequin has an average yield, although its flowering nodes (or colas) are so dense and large that they may require stakes for support as plants enter the flowering stage. Indoors, plants flower within 9 to 10 weeks; if flowers are harvested after the 10 week period, THC content may increase so that it equals or exceeds the desired CBD content. Also, because its bud structure is so dense and prone to develop mold, Harlequin may require 3 weeks, rather than the typical 10 days, to properly.\n\nThe spread of medical and recreational cannabis legalization has brought new attention to CBD as an instrument of health. Charlotte’s Web, developed for a young epilepsy patient, has sparked international attention and even drawn families to Colorado, seeking treatment that doesn’t come with a high. And although Harlequin still has a tinge of THC and some associated psychoactivity, it’s still a medically potent strain, suitable for a range of conditions. Its uplifting but functional high allows the user to perform work, errands, and even exercise. Harlequin landrace heritage has given it genetic heartiness and stability, while selective breeding by cannabist botanists has boosted the valuable concentration of THC. Harlequin’s desirable properties have also been used to yield child strain Pennywise, another CBD-heavy (albeit indica-dominant) strain.\n\n"

This strain has also been praised by some for not leaving users feeling groggy or out of it the next morning.\n\nNot really suitable for use during daytime hours, the strain is most often chosen to help alleviate a variety of different aches and pains. It has been used to treat the symptoms of glaucoma, insomnia, nausea and anorexia. Some patients find that it may ease the difficulties caused by multiple sclerosis , anxiety and depression.\n\nDr. Underground recommends growing Painkiller with the Sea of Green method, stating that it does best in both hydroponic and aeroponic setups. The strain can be grown outside or in a greenhouse as well, where it will be ready the end of  September. When it is grown indoors, the strain needs between seven and eight weeks to finish maturing for harvest of up to 600 grams. Reports from those growing it outside state yields as high as 800 grams per plant.\n\n"

They received a clone from some British travelers in the 1990s, which according to the travelers was a clone of a mother that was selected for its particularly intense Cheese smells and flavors. To increase the plants lower yields they crossed it with Mazar-i-Sharif and then crossed the resulting plant back with the original Cheese clone.\n\nMuch akin to the Cheese it comes from, Queso provides powerful bodily effects that is coupled with some mood elevation but lacks a real head high. This makes it potent medication for pain relief, stress, anxiety and insomnia. The strain can also calm nausea and increase a user's appetite.\n\nKannabia recommends this strain to growers of any level, stating that as long as the plants are not over fertilized growers are nearly guaranteed a good harvest. Queso requires at least seven weeks but for the best yield it should be given a full eight. Outdoors the strain will be ready in the first week of October. During the final week of flowering, Kannabia suggests washing the roots to preserve the flavor the strain is known for.\n\n"

The strain is a conglomeration of Super Skunk from Sensi Seeds, Big Skunk Korean, a landrace Afghan indica and Afghani Hawaiian. A strain that should be reserved for the end of the day, it can be very relaxing to both the body and the mind. It can bring on hunger or sleep with relative ease, this is especially true for those of lower tolerances.\n\nThe indica properties of the strain make it ideal for patients suffering the effects of insomnia, pain, nausea and anorexia. Since Rock Bud can make the mind rest easy, it may also be useful for stress and anxiety relief.\n\nAs Rock Bud is 80 percent indica, it tends to stay short unless exposed to a prolonged vegetation period. It is particularly resistant to spider mites and grows fairly easy. However, the smaller yields of this plant do not necessarily make it great for beginners. Needing around eight to nine weeks to finish readying the harvest indoors, Rock Bud is ready near mid-October when grown outside. Yielding at least 8 ounces per multi-branch plant, the leaves of this plant take on a deep red hue as they mature.\n\n"

A Sativa-dominant hybrid, its name is a term that comes from Japanese Zen Buddhism that literally translates to understanding. In the Zen Buddhism religion it is used to refer to enlightenment. Users easily discover the reason for the name, as within the first few minutes a clear but strong cerebral high elevates moods. It tends to ease the mind, opening it up for creativity and concentration. The psychoactive effects can sometimes catch those of lower tolerance off guard and dosing should be done carefully for those unfamiliar with it. Satori is descended from Nepalese landrace Sativa genetics and since its inception has been refined. In 2007, the strain made the top 10 strains of the year in High Times.\n\nThe earth and honey flavors of this strain may provide relief from fatigue, depression, anxiety and stress. Satori has also been known to induce an appetite, relieve headaches, alleviate the effects of some sleep disorders and lessen nerve pain. The strain may also calm the effects of sensory motor disorders like restless leg syndrome.\n\nA relatively easy strain to grow, being resistant to mold, spider mites and heat, Satori can easily be over fertilized if a grower is not careful. For that last reason, it is recommended that growers have a grow or two under their belts before they try Satori, still others have started with Satori and had good results. Plants of this strain are ready for harvest in October outside or after 65 to 70 inside. Satori can produce quite a stench and grow quite tall. Indoor yields can reach up to 600 grams, while some outdoor grows report up to 1200 grams. Tests show that the THC range for Satori is between 23 and 28 percent.\n\n"

The strain was originally clone-only and is descended from a Canadian landrace hybrid that is mostly Sativa. Unfortunately, the first iteration of this strain is nearly non-existent but a few breeders have inbred and back-crossed it to create the strain in seed form. Breeders that have created their own version of Timewarp include Jordan of the Islands, BC Bud Depot and the Next Generation Seed Company. Often tasting of lemons with a slight hint of pine, Timewarp instills a lighter calming body buzz and a bright cerebral uplifting high.\n\nSuitable for daytime use as most users do not end up feeling lethargic and weighed down, Timewarp may help make some lesser pains more manageable. Its uplifting effects may help stave off the symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression.\n\nTimewarp is  somewhat of a rare breed, it was specifically designed to be grown outdoors, where some plants can reach up to 13 feet. Created for those growers that felt they had to sacrifice flavor and potency for survivability, the strain resists pests and molds. It also has sturdy branches that can stand strong against winds. Not much information is left about growing true Timewarp but its descendants generally finish in late September or mid-October. Yields for these strains range between between 100 and 600 grams per plant.\n\n"

Their goal was to keep some of the variance of the strain without losing any quality.\n\nBeing almost entirely indica, U Pink Kush grants users a body numbing experience that can relax the mind. Great for pain relief, this strain can cause users to feel tired, lazy and hungry meaning it should be used later in the day.\n\nU Pink Kush can be grown indoors where it can take eight to nine weeks to finish, or outdoors where it finishes in early October. Outside the strain can have issues with mold and mildew, it is recommended that growers cover it during any rainstorms. For that same reason the strain is not really suitable for a greenhouse grow.  When grown properly, U Pink Kush plants can yield up to 700 grams inside and up to 1000 grams in an outdoor garden. It does not require a lot of nutrients, the breeders recommend using about half of the amount prescribed by nutrient manufacturers.\n\n"

To create the strain DJ Short began with his mostly Sativa Blueberry Line and proceeded to cross it with the mostly Indica Original Blueberry male that he uses in many of his crosses. Even though both parents were chosen from the Blueberry line, their differences cause Vanilluna to be more like an F1 hybrid than an in-bred line. The effects of this strain, which has also been deemed Vanilla Moon, are often described as calming and dreamy but most users still retain a sense of clarity.\n\nA very mellow strain that is good for deep relaxation, the strain activates the mind and is great for relieving stress and anxiety. It may also be used to alleviate minor aches and the effects of depression. Vanilluna is not usually considered very over-whelming, which can make it effective daytime medication for those of higher tolerances.\n\nWhile most plants of this strain will be relatively uniform, save for a few minor height differences, due to the nature of this strain about 15 percent of plants will vary greatly in structure and growth patterns. Vanilluna is a plant that should be grown indoors and given plenty of time for its vegetation phase. For maximum yields, this strain should be topped and allowed to flower for 55 to 60 days. It can also do very well without being topped if using the Sea of Green growing method.\n\n"

The strain appeared in the late 2000s, popping up in a few dispensaries across California and the West Coast. \n\nIt is a cross between Master Kush and Hindu Kush, which makes sense since its original name was \"Master Hindu Kush.\" In 2012, Chubbs, an administrator on the Nuggetry website, renamed the strain, feeling that the original name did not do it justice. Because several strains lay claim to the name of Master Kush, the exact lineage can be hard to nail down, but nearly all of these strains include Hindu Kush and Skunk #1. Hindu Kush is a landrace Indica from the Hindu Kush mountain range.\n  \nMace Windu produces a powerful body buzz, which can be effective at reducing pain. The buzz won't knock out most patients though those with low tolerance may find it a bit heavy. It can also relax the mind, wrapping it in fuzzy warmth that can ease stress and anxiety. Mace Windu may also be used to increase appetite and calm nausea.\n\nUnfortunately, this strain is rather elusive, and very few have had the privilege to grow it.\n\n"

He started by choosing Grape Ape from Barney's Farm and crossed it with a Strawberry Cough from the BC Bud Depot. The resulting plant from that was then back-crossed with another plant of the same phenotype. Finally, that plant was self pollinated to make Nerds an S1 hybrid. About half Indica and half Sativa, the strain's effects are relaxing and almost meditative.\n\nTasting of hash and grapes, with a bit of strawberry, Nerds may be a good choice for patients with anxiety, stress and mood disorders. It's light bodily effects may ease some aches and pains as well as nausea. The strain may also help fight the symptoms of PTSD.\n\nThis strain grows short and can do well inside, outside or even a greenhouse. Nerds should be given at least four weeks, if not five, to finish vegetating. The strain flowers for eight to nine weeks and will produce a gram per watt indoors. Outside growers may have harvests up to a pound per plant.\n\n"

High CBD strains like Pennywise have shown potential in alleviating the effects of PTSD, arthritis, epilepsy and various neurological disorders. These kinds of strains have also been observed to have neuro-protective properties.\n\nPennywise can grow to medium height but it is still very suitable for indoors, though the strain has no issues with an outdoor garden. This strain has four different phenotypes, with differences between the four being mainly bud structure and color dominance. It should be topped at least once and has a flowering period lasting 60 to 67 days. Pennywise also has a high resistance to mildew.\n\n"

The original Bubba Kush is a cross between an OG Kush and a pairing of West Coast Dog and an Old World Kush. Space Queen is the child of Romulan and Cinderella 99.

In the early 1990s the founder of Magus Genetics, Gerrit Slot began an outdoor grow with some landrace Afghanistan Indica seeds and Skunk #1 seeds. While growing the male Afghani plants pollinated a Skunk #1 female, creating a ton of F1 hybrid seeds. The following year Gerrit moved to an indoor setup and grew some clone that he got from a friend, as well as the Skunk #1 and the accidental hybrid seeds. As the plants grew he took notice of the fact that the hybrids were doing better than the pure Skunk plants but they lacked the flavor and aroma of the Skunk. Having run out of the pure Skunk seeds, Gerrit decided to cross the last of his female Skunks with pollen from some of the male hybrids. The children from this coupling grew as strongly as the F1 hybrids and had an even better smell and taste than the original Skunk plants. Warlock is the final result that would go on to be the mainstay of Magus Genetics, which would be used in nearly all their later strains.\n\nEven though the strain is Indica dominant, Warlock expresses some Sativa traits not only in terms of growth but also the effects it can produce. The high starts off cerebral but then tapers off into a relaxing body buzz. It may be used to alleviate chronic aches and pains, migraines, anxiety, stress, fatigue, nausea and depression.\n\nWarlock is a strain that can be grown well in any medium, thriving inside and outdoors in locations with warmer a autumn. It should be left in the vegetative cycle for about 35 days before forcing the flowering period, which lasts between eight and nine weeks. When grown outside, plants are ready for harvest at the end of October or early November.

Breeder DNA Genetics (who may also be responsible for stabilizing the strain Headband) created Chocolope as a cross between flavorful favorite Chocolate Thai and Cannalope Haze. The result is a dynamic, energizing sativa that has won over many followers.\n\nChocolate is a more unusual taste in the portfolio of cannabis varieties -- landrace parent strain Chocolate Thai may have achieved this flavor through some combination of terpene production and terroir, picking up nutrients from the fertile soil also used to grow coffee. Chocolate Thai was extremely popular in the U.S. in the 1980s. Similarly, Chocolope has won several honors in the High Times Cannabis Cup and the High Life Cup, and was featured on the cover of High Times magazine as Strain of the Year in 2007. Samples of Chocolope have tested at between 17% and 22% THC composition.\n\nChocolope has long, fluffy buds that take an almost cylindrical shape, unlike the nugget-like buds of more indica varieties. Leaves are dark green and relatively loosely-packed; although they can be very sticky, they’re typically easier to break up than pure indica strains and may or may not require a grinder. Pistils tend to be a vivid orange. The cured buds have a particularly dank, earthy smell with some sweetness. When buds are broken up and combusted, this earthy scent is somewhat more intense. The smoke from this strain hits smoothly -- on the inhale, it bears more resemblance to parent strain Cannalope Haze and tastes mostly fruity with some hints of chocolate. Cocoa and coffee notes are more evident as smoke is exhaled.\n\nThe mental high of Chocolope takes hold quickly. Users may notice a buzzy head high that soon morphs into an altered way of thinking. With virtually none of the heavy body stone associated with hybrids or indicas, Chocolope’s effect is motivating and energizing. Although it’s cerebral and thought-provoking, this strain allows the user to maintain a mostly clear and level head. Well suited to daytime use, it can easily accompany household tasks or more extensive errands. Medically speaking, Chocolope’s acute sense of focus can be good for those with attention deficit disorders. The emotional high and general sense of well-being may also be helpful in treating stress, anxiety, and even symptoms associated with PTSD. Despite its potency, though, many users report that the high from Chocolope lasts shorter than average.\n\nChocolope has some peculiarities that may make it a difficult strain for beginners to cultivate. As with many other purer sativas, plants can be very tall. But although outdoor environments can provide all the necessary vertical space, the strain is prone to mold, meaning that growers will need to keep a close eye on growing conditions, especially in humid areas. Indoor cultivation allows for more climate control, but presents the problem of space. That said, growers can tame the exceptional height of these plants by bending and pruning stems early in the vegetative stage. Whether indoors or outdoors, growers who supplement the plants’ feeding regimen with nutrient mixes may find that Chocolope plants have an exceptional thirst, showing signs of nutrient deficiency until properly fed. Finally, this strain has a very long flowering time. Parent strain Chocolate Thai is responsible for this lag, with a notoriously long flowering period of 14 weeks: the crossing of Chocolate Thai with Cannalope Haze allows Chocolope to have a shorter, although still significant flowering time of 10 to 12 weeks. When grown outdoors, Chocolope reaches maturity and is ready for harvest in late October to early November. This extended flowering period can be worth the wait: Chocolope may yield as much as 60 grams (or 2 ounces) per square foot.\n\nThe bracing cerebral properties of Chocolope make it a great wake and bake strain. It may be a happy accident that this variety’s flavors of cantaloupe and cocoa are a perfect fit for a breakfast meal! Low-key nighttime use of Chocolope is discouraged, as its energy and potency can have counterproductive effects on the sleep cycle. On the other hand, it makes a great social lubricant and its novelty scent and taste are bound to turn some heads. Chocolope is a great example of how crossbreeding genetically-perfected landrace strains can yield a product that is as powerful as it is aesthetically appealing.\n\n"

        "description": "Strains going by the name Fruity Pebbles have circulated since at least 2006, particularly in dispensaries in California. These strains are so named for smelling just like their namesake cereal. Although most are labeled as a hybrids or as slightly Indica-dominant, the true genetics of Fruity Pebbles may be impossible to discern, as individual growers may use different parent strains or breeding techniques. THC composition of strains labeled Fruity Pebbles have tested anywhere from 15% to 28%.\n\nOne variety, created by breeders Alien Genetics, was marketed as Fruity Pebbles OG, an April 2012 limited edition. Packs of these special Fruity Pebbles OG seeds sold for $1,000-$1,500 each. The mother, a cross of Green Ribbon and Granddaddy Purps, was bred with a strain crossed from Tahoe OG and Alien Kush. Given that successful growers can reap anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 per plant, a pack of these specialty seeds may substantially cut into profit margins for commercial growers -- and would certainly be a sunk cost for the more casual home grower.\n\nFruity Pebbles is marked by long and densely-packed conical buds that look strikingly different from the smaller, more compact nugs more typical of pure indicas. Leaves are green, although many phenotypes have vibrant shades of purple and red with contrasting orange pistils. These bright colors -- which provide further reason for this strain’s name -- are the result of anthocyanins, compounds similar to chlorophyll in the plant that produce colors when exposed to cold temperatures. Perhaps most notably, Fruity Pebbles has a sweet, tropical scent, similar to citrus and berries. Breaking the buds open yields a more spicy, hashy scent. When combusted, the smoke from this strain is smooth when drawn through a joint or a pipe and it has a sugary, fruity aftertaste.\n\nMost cannabis strains sold under the label Fruity Pebbles provide a hybrid-type high that takes hold quickly, with a soft but strong body buzz that can provide relaxation and some spacey, psychedelic effects. Many fans of the strains describe a strange physical sensation and a sharpening of the senses and a heightened awareness that can lend itself to stimulating conversation, creative projects, or even exercise. However, the more indica-dominant varieties of Fruity Pebbles have the capacity to produce produce heavy body highs that cause couchlock.  In general, these strains may be effective medication for pain, mood disorders, migraines, and attention deficit disorders. Indica-leaning phenotypes are also very helpful in relieving insomnia, and easing mental tension.\n\nThose looking to grow their own supply of Fruity Pebbles can obtain clones (healthy clippings) from mature plants. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy packaged seeds of Fruity Pebbles. Growing outdoors requires a steady temperate climate with indirect sunlight. Those looking to grow indoors should plan on having a large gros space -- depending on the phenotype, Fruity Pebbles can grow to tall sativa-like heights with a heavy yield of flowers that will need to be staked and tied to grow properly. Growers should be sure to trim fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to let light penetrate to lower branches. Indoors, plants will flower and be ready for harvest within 8 to 9 weeks. Because the flowers have a pungent, fruity odor, growers may want to equip their growing spaces with tools like carbon filters or exhaust fans. Fruity Pebbles are considered a somewhat difficult strain to grow, and may pose a challenge for the novice grower.\n\nAlthough its appearance and tropical taste may classify it as a novelty craft strain, Fruity Pebbles can be a potent standby option. Whether a hybrid that stimulates thought and creativity or an indica suited to solo evening use, this strain has a nuanced high to match its impressive taste profile. Fruity Pebbles works well in social settings -- its distinctive smell is sure to turn heads and attract some new friends, as long as you don’t mind sharing.\n\n"

The resulting strong strain is not for everyone as it can leave less experienced users in a state of confusion.\n\nFor most patients, Jack Skellington can be a great choice to relieve stress and anxiety. The euphoric properties may help regulate mood disorders, and some may find it alleviates migraines and headaches. It can be very good for meditative purposes as well.\n\nSince this strain is 70% Sativa, plants may be both tall and wide. If topped, they can be very successful when grown in a Sea of Green. Jack Skellington grows well both indoors and outside. The strain typically needs about eight weeks to mature, with buds reportedly carrying a THC of around 15%.\n\n"

The buds are colorful and may exhibit the entire spectrum of cannabis coloring. Juicy Fruit's parents are two landraces: a Thailand Sativa and an Indica from Afghanistan.\n\nSativa is dominant in Juicy Fruit. It boosts moods, fills users with energy and seems to create a 'time warp', slowing the perception of time for the users. The high can last up to three hours and can stimulate focus and creativity. The cerebral effects taper off without leaving users feeling drained. As a result, the strain is often prescribed as daytime relief for depression, stress, and anxiety. A mild body high may also accompany the cerebral effects and can assist in alleviating pain and nausea. \n\nThis strain may be hard to grow outdoors, but it thrives indoors or in a greenhouse. Juicy Fruit's Sativa dominance shines through again as plants can reach up to three meters in height. The strain needs between 50 and 60 days to finish flowering. It can reportedly produce a large yield with up to 20% THC.\n\nNote that at least two other strains have been commonly referred to as Juicy Fruit. One is more known as Jammerz, a commercially yielding strain that lacks potency. The other is Juicy Fruit Thai, a descendant of Highland Thai. A specific phenotype of Bubblegum has also been given the name Juicy Fruit.\n\n"

World of Seeds offers this strain in normal and feminized seeds. A Sativa that hits hard with a THC count of up to 18%, it can provide a very intense psychedelic cerebral high that may be overwhelming to some.\n\nThe Sativa Kilimanjaro is most comfortable when grown in an outdoor setup but can also do well in a greenhouse, thanks to its strong resistance to mold. After flowering for nine to ten weeks, it will yield up to 600 grams per plant. If grown indoors, it yields up to 350 grams per square meter.

        "description": "Bruce Lee was a master of martial arts. He could send his opponents flying with just a one-inch punch!Lee consumed cannabis, which, Shortly after his death in the 70s, created rumors that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the herb. No such evidence was found of course, since, according to Bruce Lee: Fighting Spirit, cannabis was ultimately ruled out as a cause of his death. Not quite as powerful as its namesake, the B. Lee strain is nonetheless a major hitter that sends its users soaring because its THC count is up to 20 percent.\n\nThe cerebral effects eventually fade to a subtle body buzz that can leave users feeling sedated. Kannabia Seeds, the strain's creator, wanted to take the flavor and psychoactive properties of their Citrus strain and make it an auto-flowering variety. That is how they came up with B. Lee. The Citrus strain, B. Lee's father, is mostly a Sativa cross consisting of Lemonade 2000 and Rosetta Stone from the Brothers Grimm.\n\nTasting like the fruit its mother is named after, B. Lee can be an effective medication for anxiety, stress and depression. However, because its psychedelic effect lasts approximately half an hour, it may not be the best choice for everyone. B. Lee can also be used to calm nausea, minor pains and muscle spasms.\n\nThis auto-flowering strain is easy to grow. Kannabia recommends an 18-20-hour photoperiod. Ranging between 50 and 60 centimeters in height, B. Lee is a short and speedy plant that needs just 60 to 65 days to reach harvest. When grown outside, the strain will bush out more and can reach up to 75 centimeters. These plants may produce up to 50 grams per plant and can flourish in a Sea of Green setup.\n\n"

Indica-dominant, this hybrid is a collection of Skunk #1, Northern Lights and El Nino. With a lineage that includes Cannabis from Brazil, Mexico, India, Thailand and Afghanistan, this carefully crafted and cosmically named strain has a THC range between 13 and 19 percent. Nearly narcotic in effect for some users, Big Bang took third place in the 2000 High Times Cannabis Cup.\n\nProviding a sensation of healing and general euphoria from the beginning of use, this strain has been described as rolling a soft blanket over users gently rocking them to sleep. This blanket can numb aches and pains, calm nausea, soothe muscle spasms and induce an appetite. Some users of higher tolerance find the strain allows them to be functional, though Big Bang should still be reserved for the later hours in the day.\n\nReportedly capable of producing as much as 800 grams per square meters inside, Big Bang may yield as much as a kilogram outdoors. Even with the larger yields outdoors, most recommend growing this strain in a hydroponics set up for nine weeks so that these plants reach maximum potency. Though she can be ready for harvest in eight weeks and finishes in October outside. Growers recommend starting with a lower pH while vegetating and working up to 6.5 for the flowering period.\n\n"

The Avalon father is a versatile F4 hybrid of Afghani and Blueberry. Dynamite is also an F4 hybrid, a crossing of Grapefruit and a strain of unknown origins. Very sweetly flavored with fruit and a hint of spice, Blue Dynamite effects creep up onto a user after about fifteen minutes.\n\nCerebrally stimulating, the strain boosts spirits to a higher level of comfort, easing anxiety and stress. Blue Dynamite flows with a mellow wave of relaxation that does not sap motivation but can still be used to get a full night's rest. Easily able to numb out lesser aches and pains, this strain may also help calm nausea, increase appetite and relieve headaches.\n\nGood for a grower of any level, Blue Dynamite was designed to grow well both inside and out. Staying short, generally not reaching to far above 120 centimeters, this strain typically reaches maturity after flowering for 42 to 49 days. Outdoors plants are ready for harvest in late September or early October. Yields normally reach between 400 and 500 grams per square meter.\n\n"

However, it can also be quite sedating and provide a full body numbing feeling.\n\nGreat for daytime use, Dominator helps relieve migraines, aches, and pains. It is also good for mood regulation, helping manage the symptoms of anxiety and stress.\n\nRequiring longer time to flower, Dominator can sometimes be harvested in eight weeks. Most growers, however, recommend giving it twelve weeks for best results.

Many users feel Ewok stimulates creativity.\n\nIdeal for dealing with inflammation, muscle spasms and chronic pain, Ewok may also leave users feeling heavily sedated as it wears off. Possibly a good choice for those dealing with insomnia, it may also increase appetite. The happy cerebral effects may help lessen anxiety and stress. Some users feel more focused using this strain, which may help patients suffering from ADD/ADHD.\n\nA good strain for moderately experienced growers, this hybrid needs between eight and nine weeks to mature.

Motarebel had acquired Herijuana from Woodhorse Seeds and had carefully tweaked the strain to perfection. Sannie and Motarebel often traded and worked on genetics together, so it was only natural for him to take the temporarily orphaned strain.\n\nHerijuana can have nearly 25% THC in a 100 milligram sample, and as a result it can have a positive effect on both head and body. It may be thought-provoking and meditative, and it can alleviate stress and anxiety. This strain may help regulate mood disorders, including chronic depression. The numbing effect on the body relieves pain and eases muscle twitches and spasms. Herijuana may also help with ADD/ADHD, migraines, and arthritis. Eventually, its sedative effects can put users into a deep sleep.\n\nThis strain, which smells like spicy earth, is recommended for growing indoors but some have had success in cultivating it outdoors. Herijuana grows anywhere from two to more than three meters tall and needs between seven and nine weeks to reach harvest. Fairly resistant to temperature fluctuations, mold, and fungal disease, this strain can be a good choice for beginners. It can be grown with the Sea of Green, Screen of Green or super cropping techniques. Herijuana may produce 500 grams or more per square meter.\n\n"

The One was crossed with Sannie's Jack, an F2 hybrid of Jack Herer, and then crossed with itself to make the F2 Killing Fields #7 that is Selene's mother.\n\nToted as having a low tolerance build up, Selene may be a good choice for those who like to medicate more heavily. With a THC count as high as 22 percent, this strain can be very potent and encompass both sides of the cannabis' spectrum of effects (cerebral and body). It can be effective pain medication that will not knock out most patients, instead lifting up their spirits and sending them about their day. Users with a low tolerance would be wise to approach this strain carefully.\n\nA smaller strain as plants tend to grow more like an Indica, Selene can have a lot of trouble with the outside world. She is ideal for use with the Sea of Green technique and needs at least nine weeks to finish growing though she may need a full ten.

Selecting a good male and female, Swerve proceeded to back-cross his way way to a stable F4 line that he calls SFV OG Kush.\n\nTaking third place in the 2012 High Times Cannabis Cup's Indica category, this strain tends to smell and taste like fruit and skunk. As it can be a harsh smoke, many patients recommend vaporizing SFV OG Kush. This pure Indica strain starts in the head, relieving worries, and slowly washes over the rest of the body, numbing out pain. For most the strain does not start out overtly heavy but as it tapers off, after two to three hours, it may cause users to become weighed down and tired. Some users also get the munchies from this strain.\n\nSan Fernando Valley OG Kush can be very tricky to grow but according to Swerve should just be fed lots of nutrients. Swerve prefers to grow this strain using the reverse osmosis water growing method and keeps the pH between 6.0 and 6.5. For maximum yield, Swerve recommends letting plants flower a full ten weeks though she can be harvested as early as eight. Plants should also be allowed vegetate for at least 20 days and super-cropped so that they branch out more.

        "description": "Strawberry Cough is a bracing, taste-focused sativa hybrid. Its unmistakable strawberry flavor is the result of crossbreeding by cannabis pioneer Kyle Kushman. Its impressive buds won the title of Best Flower in the 2013 Cannabis Cup. Fruity and light, this strain is an uplifting and productive smoke that can be enjoyed in a variety of settings. As its name implies, Strawberry Haze is a cross between Strawberry Fields and old-school staple Haze. The average THC composition of this strain is between 15% and 20%.\n\nKyle Kushman, a former High Times editor, developed Strawberry Cough largely by chance in 2000. Kushman claims to have received a small a clone from a fellow breeder -- a runt, the clone had allegedly been grown next to a strawberry patch somewhere in Connecticut. Kushman was struck by the clone’s pungent strawberry scent -- he dubbed the strain Strawberry Field, and eventually crossed it with a Haze plant. The result was Strawberry Cough, a hybrid that tastes soft and sweet and delivers a solidly cerebral high. Kushman built a buzz around Strawberry Cough’s in New York City’s underground cannabis market. He then moved out west to focus on cultivation in California and handed out clones of Strawberry Cough on the cross-country drive, boosting its popularity even more.\n\nThe strain’s award-winning flowers are large and chunky. Despite its dominant sativa genetics, Strawberry Cough has a more indica-typical bud structure, with solid and densely-packed leaves. The sativa genes show, however, in the buds’ tapered, conical shape, less like popcorn and more like tiny pinecones. The flowers are covered in cloudy amber trichomes that lend the leaves a slightly yellowish appearance. Red -- rather than orange -- pistils are threaded through the sticky leaves. The mild scent of strawberries wafts up from the buds, mixed with a little bit of peppery spice. When buds are combusted, they give off a herbal cloud, reminiscent of parent strain Haze. Smoke from this strain is typically harsh, causing many users to cough and sometimes leading their eyes to water. The initial taste is of ripe strawberries, without any hint of skunkiness or musk. On the exhale, the strawberry flavor has some more sweetness. This saccharine berry scent lingers for a while after users have toked.\n\nStrawberry Cough’s buzzy, thoughtful high settles in almost immediately. Users may feel initially unsettled, but, in the right set and setting, can embrace the sharp focus associated with this strain -- it’s great for deep conversation, reading, or working on tasks that involve some degree of creativity or problem-solving. Strawberry Cough can also impart an energetic feeling of motivation and intensity that’s perfect for plowing through more mundane tasks. The opportunity for non-linear and less traditional ways of thinking makes Strawberry Cough a uniquely creative strain. Its sense of euphoria and tendency towards chattiness also marks this as a great choice in lively social settings. Medically speaking, Strawberry Cough is beneficial in regulating entrenched mood disorders. As users feel a boost in energy and creativity, they may feel a dissipation in anxiety or stress. Some have also reported relief from painful migraines, as well as less intense headaches. Side effects of this strain include the possibility of paranoia, which can happen with larger doses when intense cerebral thinking can kick into overdrive. The high from Strawberry Cough is said to last longer than average, from about 3 to 4 hours.\n\nStrawberry Cough is a relatively easy strain to grow. Kyle Kushman’s original proprietary strain is clone-only, meaning that growers can only cultivate it if they can obtain a clipping from a mature, healthy plant. However, Amsterdam-based seed bank Dutch Passion has developed its own version of Strawberry Cough -- seeds are available online. Plants tend to be more short and bushy like indicas than tall and wispy like sativas -- of medium height, they are well cultivated indoors. This strain can also be grown outdoors, although plants require very warm climates and continuous temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. It flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors and in Late October when grown outdoors. Although the yield from Strawberry Cough is average, the larger-than-average buds are some consolation -- and with sturdy stems and branches, the thick flowers don’t usually require extra stakes for support.\n\nThe wide popularity of Strawberry Cough shows that taste-focused hybrids are more than just consumer novelty. This strain’s mild but distinctive taste and its expansive high have made it one of the most popular available in dispensaries today -- its appeal has even landed a mention in the apocalyptic movie Children of Men, as Michael Caine and Clive Owen share a joint of the stuff. Good for a daytime boost or an evening hang, Strawberry Cough shows how much deliberated and focused breeding can do.\n\n"

It's become a favorite for medical and recreational consumers alike, regularly being offered in dispensaries throughout the west coast. It is composed of about half Original Haze, a quarter Northern Lights #5 and a quarter Skunk #1. Tasting of spice, skunk and citrus, Super Silver Haze can deliver powerful psychoactive and physical effects.\n\nA strain that can make users want to get on their feet, it lacks focus but can be very profound and thought provoking. Motivating as it can be, Super Silver Haze shifts gears during the second half of its long lasting high and begins to soothe the body. Users may experience a brightening of colors and sharpening of sounds. For most users the strain can be effective daytime medication for fatigue, mood disorders, nausea and migraines. Some users may find the bodily effects heavier than others but it may alleviate chronic aches and pains.\n\nSuper Silver Haze does her best when grown in a hydroponics setup but don't let that stop you from growing it in soil or outside, the Mr. Nice version can be grown in a green house. The Greenhouse seeds version can take longer, up to 11 weeks to grow, than the required eight to ten weeks for the version offered at Mr. Nice. The trade off is reportedly higher yields of up to 800 grams indoor or 1500 grams per plant outside, compared to harvests of 450 to 550 grams. Not for those just starting a grow for the first time, Super Silver Haze can do well with the SCROG and LST methods of growing.\n\n"

        "description": "There are two different strains that call themselves Titanium. One is an almost entirely Indica strain created by the Vancouver Island Seed Company and the other is mostly Sativa, a product of Connoisseur Genetics. Tasting heavily of Kush, Vancouver's version of Titanium is a cross between their strain Fucking Incredible, the father, and most likely Hindu Kush. It produces effects that one would expect from such a heritage, knocking many patients on their butts and sending them to bed with a strong stoned sensation. Possibly effective medication for chronic pain and insomnia.\n\nConnoisseur Genetics' strain Titanium, is the child of Titan's Haze from the Flying Dutchman and G-13 Haze from Soma Seeds. To create Titan's Haze, the Flying Dutchman crossed their Skunk #1 and original Haze. Titanium's other parent is a mix of the Indica G-13 and Neville's Super Haze. Connoisseur's strain tastes sweet and haze-like, producing high-flying cerebral buzz. It may be used to treat anxiety, stress and mood disorders.\n\nVancouver Island's strain has a shorter flowering period thanks to its Indica dominance, which only lasts between seven and eight weeks, compared to 11 weeks for the Sativa Titanium. The Indica strain should be kept indoors but the Sativa one may be grown outside. Both of the Titanium strains are pretty easy to grow, though Connoisseur's can be prone to spider mite infestations. Vancouver's plants can produce up to 115 grams per square meter.\n\n"

It sends the mind racing, which can be thought provoking but can just as easily leave a user scatterbrained. Some users may find themselves spending three hours or more zoned out while others can just feel overwhelmed by the sedative effects. A cross between Skunk #1, a hybrid cocktail of landraces, and a Dutch strain created by Wernard Bruining called Viking, this strain makes for great night time use.\n\nFor some the cerebral effects may be too much, which may cause paranoia or anxiety. The rest will find that bodily effects to be very effective at relieving pain, treating insomnia and inducing an appetite. Some users may feel dizzy and light headed from the use of Top 44.\n\nDespite the name and claims, most growers wait seven to eight weeks before harvesting Top 44. This strain does not get very tall, generally staying under 100 centimeters, and can be an grown by those of any skill level.

Lasting up to three hours or longer, this strain can be good for relieving chronic pain and focusing on the task at hand.\n\nAlbert Walker shares a likeness with Afghan Skunk not only in taste but also in its small Indica structure. Capable of growing outside, this strain is most often cultivated indoors with organic nutrients. It can take between seven to ten weeks to deliver a heavy yield, but because this strain lacks stability, nothing is guaranteed. Albert Walker is available as a clone only.\n\n"

Some believe that Cannabis may have been given to man by the Anunnaki gods. DNA Genetics chose a northern California Hash Plant as the mother a descendant from a landrace hybrid. They crossed that Hash Plant with one of their male Cannalope Haze plants, a mix of Haze and a landrace Mexican Sativa.\n\nAnunnaki tastes fruity and hazy with a large dose of hash. The effects of this strain lift the mind and send it into overdrive. These cerebral effects may help people with mood disorders and anxiety. Some people use it for relief from epileptic symptoms, Alzheimer's disease, and migraines. It may also stimulate appetite.\n\nThis strain doesn't produce buds until its fifth week of the flowering period, which lasts nine to eleven weeks. Anunnaki shows its Sativa heritage in its height. If grown indoors, it will need to be topped, super-cropped, pruned early, or grown with the Sea of Green technique. If grown outside, Anunnaki is ready for harvest at the end of September or beginning of October. This strain may yield as much as 600 grams per square meter.\n\n"

Users most often feel spurred on by an exhilarating energy and an underlying body buzz. But some users feel the Indica effects much more strongly and quickly find themselves looking for a place to take a nap. To create this almost pure Sativa hybrid, DNA Genetics crossed a Haze with a male Mexican landrace Sativa.\n\nUsers should be careful when they decide to take this one for the first time, depending on a user's biochemistry it may be more suited for nighttime use. Cannalope Haze can effectively alleviate chronic pain, stress and anxiety. This strain may also be used to help treat diabetes, glaucoma, nausea, mood disorders, migraines and eating disorders.\n\nCannalope Haze can do well outdoors in warmer climates but does best indoors in a Sea of Green, due to its structure. This strain focuses on a main cola at the top and has many smaller branches, which is atypical of a Sativa. When grown in a Sea of Green it should only be left in the vegetative period for two weeks. The following eight to nine weeks of flowering will allow for a yield of twenty grams or more per plant. Cannalope Haze grows better in soil than it does hydroponically.\n\n"

Trainwreck, crossed with Trinity, was then pollinated by a male Jack the Ripper owned by Dioxide. The result was Chernobyl - a strain that went on to be one of High Times strains of the Year in 2010. It is a long-lasting, lime-tasting, and mind-melting Sativa-dominant hybrid.\n\nThe effects of this strain can last up to three hours and induce a strong euphoria that fills users with an intense energetic buzz.

Eventually, the strain's popularity began to fade due to its lower THC count and difficulty to grow. Some even claim that true Chocolate Thai went extinct in the mid-to-late 1980s.\n\nThe strain has been used in several hybrids in an attempt to save its particular flavor and effects. Real Chocolate Thai seeds were dark, often jet black, tiny, and spherical. Hard to come across and equally hard to sprout, this strain tended to hermie and died very easily. A dark plant, it had long and slim leaves growing in an asymmetrical fashion. It would have to survive 14 weeks to produce a small yield. In its heyday, the buds of this strain were sold tied to a stick, hemp, or bamboo with hemp rope like buds of another popular Thailand landrace strain Thai Stick.\n\n"

When he came upon a strain called Mexican Rudy, which many believe to be a cross between a Russian Ruderalis and a Mexican Sativa, he knew he had found the most crucial component. Unfortunately, like most Ruderalis-dominant strains, Mexican Rudy was weak in flavor and potency. To combat these flaws, the Joint Doctor first crossed Mexican Rudy with a female Northern Lights #2. Pleased with the results, he went on to cross that child with a male William's Wonder. Nine generations of inbreeding followed to perfect and stabilize Lowryder.\n\nNot overly strong, the cerebral effects of this strain are clear and peaceful, ideal for meditation and introspection.

The father is a mix of Triangle Kush, Ghost OG and Chemdawg. \n\nMost certainly Indica dominant, Rug Burn OG has a body buzz that would be narcotic if not for the fact that it is accompanied by a happy mental high. This means it may be used to burn away fatigue, anxiety and stress. Good for daytime pain relief and wiping away depression, the strain can also have users clearing out the cupboards to look for snacks - rendering it a decent remedy for appetite loss or nausea.\n\nA very forgiving strain, this Indica-dominant hybrid tends to overlook things beginners do wrong that many other strains would find offensive. While it might have no issues outdoors, everyone tends to keep this one inside, despite how tall it may get. Yielding over 200 grams per square meter after seven to nine weeks of flowering, Rug Burn OG should be ready for harvest outdoors in October.\n\n"

Most users do not find the bodily effects too heavy but some may find the cerebral effects induce anxiety. Typically lasting between an hour or two, this strain can leave users looking to raid the fridge. Unfortunately, the exact story behind Sonoma Coma's genetics seemed to be a closely guarded secret. Though no one is 100 percent sure where it came from, a dispensary in Vallejo, California, named Happy Lil Trees entered it into the first High Times Medical Cannabis Cup in 2012. Sonoma Coma took first prize in the Sativa category that year.\n\nThe flavor of his strain is sweet, like tropical fruit, and spicy like hash. Described as having no limits, users may be able medicate with this one endlessly but the higher one reaches the more likely they are to experience anxiety or paranoia. Still, at lower levels Sonoma Coma can be very energetic and happy, which may be used to treat depression, stress, anxiety, appetite loss, and fatigue. This strain may have a THC count of 20 percent or more.\n\n"

The breeder began with a female from his infamous Super Silver Haze genetics - which won three consecutive Cannabis Cups in 1997, 1998 and 1999 - and carefully bred this with a 3-way cross of Haze, Skunk #1 and Northern Lights #5.\n\nArjan then bred that by-product with the more popular Lemon Skunk - a strain that made its way from Las Vegas to Amsterdam by way of a breeder named The Lemon Man - to get the Super Lemon Haze you see today in dispensaries throughout the West Coast.\n\nThe genetics of Super Lemon Haze combine sweet and tart, lemony tastes (partially due to the terpene Limonene) and aromas that make for a mellow high that begins in the body but quickly flows to the mind. The THC count of this strain can reach as high as 25 percent, which can lead to paranoia and anxiety when consumed in larger quantities by novice smokers.\n\nEnergetic and social, this hybrid can be great daytime medication for eliminating fatigue, anxiety and stress. The mood elevating properties of Super Lemon Haze may also help regulate mood disorders, such as chronic depression, PTSD and/or anxiety. This strain may help patients dealing with minor pains, nausea and appetite loss. It may also help patients over come ADD/ADHD and migraines.\n\nNot the best choice for an amateur's first grow, Super Lemon Haze is a strain that does not require a lot of attention, though it may need support during flowering. That period of growth can last between 56 and 65 days, which makes plants ready for harvest in October or November outside. Super Lemon Haze is well suited for the Screen of Green technique. Inside growers may get as much as 600 grams per square meter come harvest, outdoors this may be as much as 800 grams per plant. Super Lemon Haze is resistant to the fungus Botrytis, gray mold.\n\n"

They state that the Indica has been around since the late 1980s on Vancouver Island and in California.

It may also help with glaucoma, inflammation and migraines.\n\nThis strain will show its true color when grown in hyrdoponics or outdoors, but it can also be grown in soil. A heavy yielding Indica, it stays short and loves nutrients. To reach harvest The Black will need eight to ten weeks to finish flowering. Outside it is ready mid-October.\n\n"

These effects are slightly overshadowed by the strong warming and numbing sensations that flow over the body. Great for those that need pain relief in the morning or afternoon, the strain may also calm muscle spasms, migraines and headaches. It may calm nausea, anxiety, stress and mood disorders.\n\nBy pollinating a female MK Ultra with the well known male G13 Haze, Resin Seeds created an earthy and citrus tasting strain.\n\nResistant to many pests, Cannatonic has reportedly had some issues with molds and mildews, meaning it should probably be kept in a controlled environment or carefully watched. Resin Seeds keeps some very in depth growing information on their website for the strain when grown indoors. They recommend vegetating for a week, using Bio Vega and Bio Rhizotonic. Clones may need an eye kept on them to ensure the development of a strong root system. After the vegetative period comes a nine week flowering period, during the last of which Resin Seeds advises lowering the hours of light to ten from twelve. Cannatonic plants may yield up to 500 grams per square meter indoors.

It is also helpful to people dealing with chronic pain and may help with migraines, glaucoma, and inflammation.\n\nRarely breaking 70 centimeters in height, Crimea Blue can be great for the Sea of Green or Screen of Green growing methods.

This hybrid tends to stimulate appetite.\n\nFor the best flavor, this strain should be grown in soil, inside or out, but it can also do well in a hydroponics grow. Flowerbomb Kush plants have long side branches that can compete with the main cola and should be pruned often. This strain needs about eight weeks to finish flowering, after which growers may harvest up to 0.8 grams per watt indoors with 1000W HPS.

        "description": "With a menacing name that hints at its powerful psychoactivity, Durban Poison is a pure South African sativa landrace. It is a bold and sticky variety that’s well adapted to a variety of growing conditions. Durban Poison boasts a THC content of between 15% and 25%.\n\nCannabis has been cultivated on the African continent since at least the 14th century; by the era of Dutch colonization, it had spread south and the Khoikhoi, San, and Bantu groups indigenous to South Africa had an established cultivation and cultural acceptance of the drug, which they called dagga.\n\nIn the late 1970s, American breeder Ed Rosenthal selectively bred several plants from a bag of South African seeds that he brought back to the U.S. Rosenthal then passed some prime specimens on to fellow breeder Mel Frank, who fine-tuned the genetics to optimize resin content and flowering time. Frank’s efforts resulted in “A” and “B” lines of the original seed stock; the B line was given to Amsterdam breeder Sam the Skunkman, who further reduced the strain’s flowering time.\n\nBuds of Durban Poison are medium to large in size. Although they have a dense, compact structure typical of indica varieties, their long and tapered shape is more characteristic of sativas. The forest green leaves are offset by bright orange pistils, meant to catch pollen from male fertilizing plants. A coating of milky-white trichomes gives the cured flowers a light sheen and an incredibly sticky texture. Durban Poison has a classically dank smell punctuated by hints of sweet licorice. The flowers are pungent and skunky when broken open or burnt and give off a thick, lung-expanding smoke. The licorice aroma is evident on the exhale, along with the taste of sweet, almost cloying pine sap.\n\nDurban Poison has a clear, focused high that hits users right away. The amplification of sights and sounds may be initially disorienting but in the right setting can slide into an active, buzzy head high. Almost entirely cerebral with no hints of debilitating heaviness or couchlock, this strain can be especially helpful for creative endeavors -- it’s a great way to contemplate the nuances of an intense movie or a piece of music. Durban Poison can also be a strong social lubricant, helping smokers to feel chatty and more at ease. Any medical benefits are more mental than physical -- this strain can confer a sense of mindfulness to help those perpetually distracted by depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It can also help those with attention deficit disorders maintain a deep, intense focus. Because it’s so potent and cerebral, Durban Poison can also have some undesirable side effects. It may put users into overdrive, making them feel on edge or jittery. It can also lead to a kind of rapid-association “mindrace,” making smokers feel paranoid or out of control. Definitely more suited to daytime than sleepy nighttime use, Durban Poison is a quintessential wake and bake strain. Its high typically lasts between 2 and 3 hours.\n\nBecause of its hardy and time-tested genetics, Durban Poison is a good grow for newcomers to cultivation. It can reach 12 feet in height, and as such, can be successfully grown outdoors in warm, semi-humid climates with consistent daily temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growers will want to tame Durban Poison’s height by bending and pruning the spindly branches early on in the vegetative stage. Thanks to its time-tested cultivation and internationally-engineered genetics, this strain flowers remarkably quickly for a sativa, reaching maturity in 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and by late September when grown outdoors. Plants also reward growers with a higher than average yield.\n\nNamed after South Africa’s second largest city, Durban Poison offers a chance to enjoy one of Africa’s contributions to the panoply of potent global landrace strains. It has a sweet, hashy smell and a high resin content that makes it particularly valuable in the production of THC concentrates like shatter and wax. Often likened to espresso, Durban Poison gives users a mobile and active high that’s as enjoyable at a party as it is at alone, accomplishing creative or mundane tasks.\n\n"

        "description": "Deadhead OG is a hybrid medical marijuana strain with a lineage of both Sativa and Indica. Chemdawg 91 (Sativa) accounts for 60% of its DNA, while SFV OG Kush makes up the other 40%. Its THC content regularly reaches above 20.0%, and its CBD content is generally around 0.20%. This classic strain was created by master breeder Skunk VA at The Cali Connection in June 2011. Since its birth, it has become highly popular in the western region of the U.S.\n\nThe aroma of Deadhead is very pungent, yet pleasant. Patients often describe notes of pine, lemon, and wood in both the raw buds and the smoke. Its earthy fragrance is very smooth, but can easily permeate a house.\n\nA wide range of ailments can be successfully treated by Deadhead OG, including anxiety, insomnia, chronic depression, stress, and pain. Once smoked, mood elevation sets in almost immediately. Feelings of amusement and euphoria are common, and this mood improvement generally lasts for several hours. The mental high is very stimulating, resulting in increased focus and introspection, rather than a dazed, stoned feeling. It is recommended for those who want to be able to stay active after medicating. While the high does not induce lethargy, it does increase relaxation and one’s ability to fall asleep.\n\nAccompanying the cerebral high is a soothing body high. It calms muscles and jitters, dampening any pain.\n\nReported side effects include paranoia, anxiety, dizziness, dry mouth, and dry eyes, but only in rare cases. Because Deadhead is such a potent strain, it is not recommended for patients who are new to smoking cannabis, or have a low tolerance level.\n\nDeadhead OG is a hardy plant that can grow in a variety of setups, both indoor and outdoor. It also flourishes with hydroponics. The plant generally grows to a medium height, producing medium to high yields depending on the favorability of the growing conditions. Average yields come out to 600 gm per square meter. The flower stage typically lasts anywhere from 8 to 10 weeks. The large and sticky buds produced are fuzzy with hairs of white and orange, which are thickly crusted with THC.  Deadhead’s adaptability and ease of growing makes it an ideal choice for novice growers. \n\n"

        "description": "Tangerine Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an unforgettable taste. Created by Amsterdam-based seed company Barney’s Farm, it is a cross between G13 and Haze descendant Neville’s Haze. The strain offers a bold citrus flavor profile as well as a clearheaded, well-balanced high that keeps users both relaxed and alert. This tasty variety won First Place overall in the 2010 Cannabis Cup. It boasts an impressive THC content that hovers around 25%.\n\nFlowers of this strain grow large and chunky, with a dense bud structure that’s more typical of indica than sativa varieties. The leaves are forest green, with some phenotypes showing traces of dark purple. This latter color results when pigments called anthocyanins are brought out by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The flowers are covered in sticky white trichomes that give flowers a dewy look -- and account for this strain’s high THC content. Orange pistils are threaded through these colorful leaves. The intense citrus fragrance is where this strain really lives up to its bag appeal -- the cured flowers give off a scent of orange with some sweet earthiness mixed in. Many fans also describe a spicy, clove-like undertone, further enhancing the orange top notes. Breaking up the sticky buds yields a more herbal funk, likely passed on from Haze genetics. Smoke hits smoothly and has a chemical-like, diesel taste. When exhaled, smoke has the distinct taste of orange zest, along with a slight tanginess that lingers on the palate.\n\nTangerine Dream smokers usually feel an immediate head rush that leaves the senses buzzing. What follows is a spreading feeling of warmth and emotional uplift that can be disorienting in the short term. Thought-provoking and cerebral, but still grounded, this strain offers a high that can be as productive or as lazy as users intend. This balance can tip towards a heavier body high in larger doses, however. Medically, Tangerine Dream has application for mood disorders. It can be a source of relief for those suffering from stress and anxiety. Its functional sense of focus may also be beneficial for users with attention deficit disorders. Some may feel a relaxation of tense muscles and relief from chronic aches and pains. If enough is consumed, Tangerine Dream can also be a sleep-inducing treatment for insomnia.\n\nTangerine Dream can be grown indoors and outdoors, although outdoor growing requires warm and humid climates with consistent sunlight. The short and bushy plants are more characteristic of indica varieties and can easily be cultivated indoors, as they range between 3 and 4 feet tall when fully grown. This strain’s hardy genetics make for thick central stems and supporting branches to hold up the dense buds -- this means that growers may not necessarily need to provide staked supports as plants entering the flowering stage. Flowering happens within 8 to 10 weeks when plants are grown indoors, and flowers are ready for harvest by late October when grown outdoors. Tangerine Dream has a fairly high yield of about 46 to 56 grams (or 1.6 to 2 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\nIn order to preserve the characteristic taste of the carefully-grown buds (and to keep smoke as smooth as possible), users should also be sure to cure the flowers. Curing is a two-stage process: First, growers should hang the buds upside down by the stem or lay them on drying racks that provide air circulation for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers relatively easily, growers can then seal the buds in airtight wide-mouthed jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and temperature around 70 degrees. While they cure in the jars, buds should be checked at least daily for a week to ensure that they haven’t developed mold.\n\nSharing its name with an influential German progressive electronic band, Tangerine Dream is an uncommonly tasty and potent strain. Its pleasant flavor and scent can be fun to share with friends (or enthusiastic strangers), as well as to savor alone in relaxed surroundings. This strain’s complex spicy and citrus flavor profile also make it an appealing variety to pair with food or drinks that have similarly bold flavors.\n\n"

Even the scent of Sweet Tooth is pleasant and flowery. \n\nWhile the strain is definitely Indica dominant, the dash of sativa helps keep the user lucid when utilized in moderation. It is advisable to use Sweet Tooth at night time or on a lazy day with nothing planned, as it produces a powerful body stone. It probably won't be a good choice before social festivities, but for introspective nights back home it can prove useful.\n\nSweet Tooth can be used for a variety of medical ailments. This strain can prove a very effective pain reliever, be it chronic or debilitating pain, or those suffering from arthritis or general aching in the back, neck, or joints. So while it does provide a great, lazy stone that is effective in alleviating various pains, it is best to remember and anticipate the potential of a lazy day. It is for this reason it is also a successful remedy for insomnia, lulling the user into a relaxing sleep. \n\nSweet Tooth buds have a light-to-medium, greenish hue, covered in appetizing orange hairs and the aforementioned, sugary crystal frosting. Later in life as the plant ripens, it can also yield dark purple tinges amongst the leaves of the buds. Sweet Tooth buds are quite dense.\n\nSweet Tooth can be grown both indoors and outdoors, and is known to have a fast flowering time at around 40 to 55 days. Height, on average should finish at roughly 6 to 8 feet outdoors, or 3 to 4 feet indoors. Sweet Tooth plants are also commonly referenced as survivors, bravely facing the onslaught of pests.\n\n"

It is a favorite in Colorado. Bruce Banner actually comes in three specific variants, with Bruce Banner #3 being the most coveted of the three. Initially, 5 Bruce Banner strains existed, Bruce Banner #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5. Bruce Banner #2 and #4 were both quickly drop, with #1, #3, and #5 taking precedence. Bruce Banner #3 ranked first place in the Denver US Cannabis Cup, and is the most potent strain ever tested in the history of the High Times Cannabis Cups. Bruce Banner received a great amount of hype in 2009, right as medical cannabis started receiving a better reception in the mainstream.\n\nPlants of this strain tend to flower at around 8 to 10 weeks, and is a true beauty to behold as it grows. The leaves are colored a rich magenta hue, dancing vividly off the bright green buds and red hairs. The buds are frosted generously with large-headed trichomes. Bruce Banner tends to offer bigger yields than your typical OG Kush, making it a great strain choice for more experienced growers looking for an exotic strain which boasts bountiful yields.\n\n"

While the sativa effects are dominant, the euphoria is punctuated with the supplementary influence of indica effects as well. This strain is often hailed in Northern California as \"Momma Kush.\"\n\nCannalope Kush has dense, light green nuggets that are generously frosted and covered in wiry orange hairs. The compact buds are dotted with thin, light green leaves. These beautiful nuggets have a balanced effect that can sometimes be a bit racy depending on dosage. While some get a nice cerebral euphoria and boost in creativity, it also tends to elevate the mood and bring in casual relaxation, making ideal for a late afternoon toke or celebratory wake and bake. Expect a pleasant pressure around the temples and behind the eyes. This strain can be used to treat migraines, anxiety issues, depression, and sleeping disorders such as insomnia. \n\nThe aroma of Cannalope Kush is a surprising blend of fresh cut cantaloupe with haze undertones, almost like a subtle perfume. The taste of the smoke is light and pleasant with woody undertones, with subtle fruit vibes but with no citrus. Many deem the taste both crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe yield of Cannalope Kush is quite bountiful, and alongside an indoor 8-9 week flowering time, it proves satisfactory for growers worldwide. Outdoor flowering time the plant finishes at the end of October in California and areas with a similar climate, and a slightly later finish in colder and darker climates. The buds are long and resinous, and with the high quality of the product, this strain more than solidifies a strong reputation of worth among growers. It is advised to grow Cannalope Kush seeds in soil for best results, as opposed to using hydroponics. While trichome frosts appear early in flowering, patient growers will be delighted at the spike in quality should they allow their plants to reach a full meter of height before harvesting. Average plant size is generally 3 to 5 feet tall.\n\n"

        "description": "A sativa-dominant hybrid with a distinctive color and odor, Golden Goat was created largely by chance. Unidentified breeders in Topeka, Kansas -- an area not usually thought of as a cannabis hot spot -- found that a male plant of hybrid Hawaiian/Romulan had fertilized a female plant of sativa Island Sweet Skunk. The result was a strain with colorful flowers and high trichome production that’s come to be known as Golden Goat. This happy accident is valued for its strong and well-balanced high and its soothing analgesic properties. Golden Goat has 1% of pain-relieving CBD in its genes, as well as THC composition that averages about 16% but can test as high as 23%.\n\nGolden Goat has dense and medium-sized buds that have a solidly indica appearance, with heavy and tightly-packed leaves. Its leaves are a bright green with some hints of pink or red in certain phenotypes -- these varied hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being activated by unusually cold weather during the plants’ vegetative state. The flowers are also very resinous and coated in amber-colored trichomes that give the cured buds the golden glow that’s referenced in this strain’s name. When grown and cured properly, buds are very sticky and when handled will leave behind a good amount of residue. Adding to Golden Goat’s bag appeal is a strong and complex scent. The initial impression is fruity and tropical, as is typical of Hawaiian landrace-descended strains like Mango. This citrus profile exists alongside a more sour tinge, likely the result of the Island Sweet Skunk parent strain. To round this all out, buds can smell spicy and earthy when burned. All of these notes come together in a strong and acrid smoke that can sting the eyes and tickle the throat, causing users to cough. Although some find it pleasant, others have described Golden Goat’s scent and taste as a clash of incompatible flavors, leading to some conjecture that the “goat” in its name is actually meant to describe this strain’s taste. This is an especially pungent variety, so smokers looking to maintain discretion should plan accordingly.\n\nGolden Goat has a high that creeps up gradually instead of hitting users right away. It begins as a buzzy sativa-like high marked by altered perception; users may sense a magnification of their surroundings with sharper sounds and enhanced colors. In a short amount of time, though, this sensory distortion mellows out into physical relaxation. Users feel a kind of calm radiating from the neck down through the limbs, which allows for a grounding that stops the sativa side of the high from becoming too disorienting. Although relaxing, the body stone from Golden Goat isn’t so heavy that it will induce couchlock -- smokers can still be as mobile as they’d like, making this a great strain for daytime or nighttime use. Golden Goat has some medical benefits as well, conferred by small amounts of the cannabinoid CBD as well as by the sedative indica effects. The simultaneous feelings of emotional uplift and physical relaxation can be helpful in regulating the symptoms of anxiety, depression, or even PTSD. Its mildly painkilling effects can also be useful for relieving chronic aches and pains. Finally, if consumed in large enough doses, Golden Goat can provide the full sedative effects necessary to put users into a restful sleep, thus tempering the difficult symptoms of insomnia. Although its high tends to be shorter than average, lasting between 1.5 to 2.5 hours, Golden Goat’s high THC content may lead some to moderate their dosage -- a little bit can go a long way.\n\nGolden Goat is a clone-only strain, meaning that in order to cultivate it, growers can’t purchase packaged seeds, but instead need to obtain and transplant clippings from mature Golden Goat plants. While it can be successfully grown outdoors or indoors, the characteristically sativa height of its plants may make outdoor growing a more appealing option. That said, those looking to grow this or any other cannabis strain outdoors will need to ensure consistent sunlight and temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because they are tall and wispy with widely-spaced flowering nodes, Golden Goat plants may not require growers to trim broad fan leaves during the vegetative stage. As with many other sativas, the flowering period can be long, happening within 9 to 11 weeks.\n\nVery popular in West Coast dispensaries, Golden Goat maintains a consistent appeal for its balance between clearheaded thoughtfulness and physical calm. Its versatility makes it as welcome in conversational social situations as it is in more quiet, introspective settings. We can thank Golden Goat’s many landrace ancestors -- Hawaiian and North American on one side, Afghani, Colombian, and Mexican on the other -- for such a fun and productive high, even if they’ve produced some clashing and stinky goat-like odors.\n\n"

Its lineage consists of both Sativa and Indica parents, but the effects of God Bud are almost entirely from its Indica side. God Bud was originally created by a well known Canadian cannabis seed company in British Columbia called BC Bud Depot. They mixed an almost pure Sativa strain called Hawaiin with a very strong purple Indica strain to create the 'God Bud.'\n\nGod Bud has won a few awards in it's day - most notably the High Times Indica Cup in 2004 - and has been a dispensary favorite in Vancouver, BC. You can now find the strain up and down the West Coast as well as Colorado. \n\nWhen grown properly the strain comes out quite fluffy and completely covered in trichomes. In fact, the massive amounts of trichomes this strain produces may even make the buds appear white from a distance. It's taste is earthy with a hint of citrus and tropical fruit from it's Hawaiin lineage giving it a sweet aftertaste. \n\nBecause God Bud's effects lean so much on the Indica side the strain should mostly be relegated to night time or evening use. Along with euphoria and relaxation the strain can impart sleepiness and drowsiness especially when consumed in larger doses or by novice users. The strain is great for insomnia as well as depression and has even proven to be an effective appetite stimulant. \n\nGod Bud can be grown both indoors and out. With indoor set ups expect anywhere from 2-4 ounces per plant. With outdoor set ups the yields can be significantly higher - with yields topping 3 pounds per plant in southern climates. The plant will remain relatively short, even when mature, thanks in part to it's heavy Indica heritage. Expect flowering between 50-55 days. \n\n"

It's effects lean towards it's Sativa properties making it a mentally stimulating strain with little to no body effects when smoked in smaller doses. The strain is great for social functions or creative activities - anything where your brain must be active and engaged. When consumed in larger quantities, and especially by novice users, the strain can impart anxiety and paranoia as is typical with strong Sativa strains. You many want to try a hit or two before committing to a full joint.\n\nCandyland is a comparatively easy strain to grow when weighed against other Sativas. It can be grown indoors and outdoors with a flowering period of between 8-9 weeks on an indoor grow and a September harvest for outdoor grows. The weight really piles on towards the end of the grow cycle as the buds begin to weigh down the plant's rather tall and skinny frame.

The product of these two, Grand Daddy Purple, is a spitting image of it's parents' two best qualities - the deep and dark purple hue from Purple Urkle and the overgrown, dense buds of Big Bud. The dark purple buds blend well with the bright orange hairs and frosted white trichomes that generously cover the bud making it an extremely photogenic strain.\n\nFrom San Francisco down to Los Angeles, Grand Daddy Purple is one of the most sought after Indica strains due to it's Hollywood looks and classic Indica effects. Despite this popularity, however, many growers and those working in the dispensary world have claimed that Grand Daddy Purps is almost identical to another famous purple strain - Grape Ape. Some even go so far as to speculate that these two strains may be in fact the same. Others simply say that they are so eerily similar in lineage, look, taste, and effects that they are simply confused with one another by growers, dispensaries, and consumers alike. \n\nPerfect for night time use Grand Daddy Purple hits both the body and mind initially but quickly fades into a smooth body buzz like most heavy Indicas do. For patients Grand Daddy Purps is ideal for pain management. It can also be effective at treating insomnia, depression and anxiety. Novice users beware though, this strain can pack a powerful punch. We'd recommend starting with a hit or two and waiting a few minutes before opting to consume more\n\nGrand Daddy Purple grows best indoors but can be grown outside as well. Flowering commences usually around 70-77 days when grown indoors and growers can expect harvest in early October when grown outdoors. The oversized buds may begin to weigh down the plant, especially if grown outdoors. When grown indoors the plant should be short and stocky enough to hold the weight but you may want to prepared to offer some support around the 60 day mark if you notice the buds beginning to wear down the plant's frame. Yields can top 4 ounces per plant on an indoor grow and well over 3 pounds per plant on an outdoor grow.

It is regularly referred to as \"Purple Urple\" and occasionally \"The Urkle\". \n\n\n\nWhile most veteran cannabis growers in the Emerald Triangle region are generally tight lipped about their strain hybrids and genetics, most growers assume Purple Urkle was the offspring of either Mendocino Purps or Granddaddy Purple. \n\n\n\nIt's effects, taste and smell are fairly consistent with most purple strains of marijuana when grown properly. Purple Urkle has a sweet and skunky smell generally containing the aromas of tropical fruit, grapes, fruity pebbles and skunk. As with many heavy Indica strains it's effects can be quite lethargic and relaxing making it an excellent strain for insomnia and anxiety. It is also used regularly for pain management and as an appetite stimulant. \n\n\n\nDue to it's sedating effects it is best left for late evening or night time use.

The body may feel sleepy and hungry, while the mind stays active and creative.\n\nThis strain is for the medically needy as it treats the pain, nausea, and appetite loss often found in serious disorders. THC content is high but CBD levels are low, making it unsuitable to calm seizure sufferers. Choose it for the sleepy effect and the waves of pain relief.\n\nWhile it also alleviates insomnia, arthritis, and stress, casual and recreational users often choose this strain due to its name recognition. In 2013, Thin Mint Cookies' parent, Girl Scout Cookies, won 1st place for a Hybrid in the Cannabis Cup held in Denver, CO. The Thin Mint Cookie strain has placed in the top three in competitions in California and Washington.\n\nTo differentiate the strains, experts in the laboratory focus on the terpene and cannabinoid profiles because all cannabis buds produce THC. High terpene found in Thin Mint Cookies suggests its ancestry to Girl Scout Cookies, the caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool say Kush, while THCV indicates Durban Poison.\n\nBecause it is a child of famous strain, the hereditary lineage of Thin Mint Cookies is of interest. The original breeders of Girl Scout Cookies told High Times magazine that they crossed a mystery strain (F1) that they called their \"secret sauce\" with Durban Poison and OG Kush.\n\nHigh Times' laboratory analysis of a Girl Scout Cookie lookalike found (in percent mass): 1.16% CBG; 22.3% THC; 0.07% THCV; 0.17% linalool; 0.39% myrcene; 0.37% limonene; 0.71% caryophyllene.\n\nA phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies, the Thin Mint Cookie cannabis strain is a lookalike with similar properties. The strain provides potent medical relief due to its sleep-inducing properties, pain relief, and nausea relief. Recreational users may appreciate it for its cerebral and creative effects.\n\n"

        "description": "Purple Widow, a 55 percent Indica and 45 percent Sativa strain, is a cross between the lesser known 'Purple Power' and the now infamous White Widow.\n\nIt grows sturdy and features spectacular colors - generally displaying many hue's of purple and dark green. For a 'purple' variety of cannabis the Purple Widow plant is relatively strong. It produces large purple, trichome-covered buds that are packed with sticky resin. Purple Widow has a sweet, fruity aroma and flavor, with specific hints of berry. When smoked, this strain combines the heavy body stone associated with it's Indica side as well as the cerebral or \"trippy feel\" offered by it's Sativa heritage.\n\nThe Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in purple widow generally sits around 20 percent when grown properly and the Cannabidiol (CBD) level is ~1 percent. The effects of this strain of cannabis are energetic, euphoric, focused, happy, and relaxed - making it a delightful afternoon or early evening strain.\n\nMedicinal uses of Purple Widow include mitigating anxiety, depression, migraines, stress, and increasing appetite. It is offered by medical dispensaries throughout the west coast for insomnia, nausea, pain relief, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, and stress. Adverse effects may include dry mouth and dry eyes.\n\nThe flowering time of purple widow is around 64 to 71 days when grown indoors. Outdoors, the harvest time is typically around the end of October or beginning of November in the northern hemisphere.\n\nOverall, Purple Widow is failry easy to grow. It produces average yields indoors with much higher yields outdoors (although generally at the expense of lower THC content).\n\nOutdoors this plant can reach a height of 3.5 meters and can yield up to 850 grams per square meter. Indoor plants rarely grow taller than 5 feet (less than 2 meters) and produce a lesser yield of up to 400 grams per square meter.\n\n"

Nugs are long and dense, bright green with red undertones and amber hairs, and a thick layer of crystal trichomes.\n\nLevels of active ingredient Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in Hurricane range from 12-18% with an active Cannabidiol (CBD) level of 14.95%. Hurricane is generally considered a strain for daytime use due to it's Sativa-leaning genetics and it's high CBD count.\n\nHurricane users report that it creates alertness, focus, motivation, and euphoria. Some users report that it has peaceful and calming effects as well. As a result of these effects, Hurricane has been suggested to treat conditions like depression, attention disorders, and anxiety. This strain may also benefit people suffering from conditions like chronic pain, nausea, muscle spasms, and lack of appetite.\n\nHurricane strains are quite tall and thin and provide low-medium yields with flowering time of 60-65 days when grown properly indoors. Outdoor harvests can be expected around late September to early October with signicantly larger yields.\n\n"

Their offspring, Purple Trainwreck, carries a combination of their best traits. \n\nThe Purple Trainwreck strain has a purple appearance and lemon/berry smell. Some people note a green and crystalized appearance with a spicy aroma.\n\nLab tests show above average THC content of 17.4 percent and CBD of 1.5 percent. Purple Trainwreck is high in alpha-pinene terpene, which is one way to identify it from other strains. Terpenes, in general, are a reliable way to distinguish strains.\n\nJeff Raber is the President of the Werc Shop in Los Angeles, a cannabis testing facility. He told High Times magazine, “A terpene analysis is like a fingerprint. It can tell you if it’s the same strain under different names. We can see strains going by different names that have the same terpene profile. We now know those strains are identical.”\n\nThe lab has tested dozens of samples of Purple Trainwreck and seen a consistent terpene profile.\n\nPeople rely on Purple Trainwreck for multiple medical uses including pain, nausea, glaucoma, migraines, cancer, and epilepsy. Users report euphoric and energetic effects combined with pain relief. Some say that the effects are long-lasting and often lead to sleep. Due to its long-lasting effect, medical patients can dose at night, and expect lingering pain relief or symptom relief in the morning. \n\nFor recreational users, Purple Trainwreck is versatile. The uplifting mood is suitable for day-time use as a passenger on a road trip, or for a cerebral, creative mood doing an art project. The indica side of the strain works for friends hanging in the hot tub, watching a movie, meditating, or drifting off to dream land. \n\nPeople have reported an immediate mental effect that moved very quickly into a lethargic, stoned state. Others say that Purple Trainwreck has targeted pain relief, not just a general dissipation of pain, but a specific body part or area that felt better.\n\nA balanced hybrid for the medical and recreational user, Purple Trainwreck has abilities to satisfy both. The strain works in the mind and the body to produce both joy and calm, pain relief, and eventually peaceful sleep.\n\n"

Three years later came Super Skunk, which the breeder, Sensei Seeds, calls the first hybrid breeding project with Afghani roots. The breeder says that Super Skunk adds potency, weight, and flavor to Skunk #1 and Shiva Skunk. \n\nThe company continues its experiments in Afghan hybrids, as do other companies in the U.S. and abroad. Breeders are chasing the dream of a perfect Afghani genotype that matches Skunk #1. Their passion stems from Skunk #1’s global influence since the 1970s and it's crosses that span generations including Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold.\n\nSuper Skunk inherits its parent’s aromatic values, which people call skunk due to its overwhelming resemblance to the black and white woodland creature. Others say that the smell is like cheese or the fungus underside of a rock. People describe the smoke as clean and the taste as sweet.\n\nSuper Skunk is green in color, but some people have noticed undertones of orange and brown. Buds are dense with short trichromes, the hair, outgrowths, or appendages on the plant. Some say the skunky smell reminds them of ammonia while others say Super Skunk has fruity notes of pomegranate and cranberry. The pleasant effects are short-acting to medium-acting, for about 90 minutes.\n\nThe heavy, Indica-style body buzz is good for medical users. You can use it all times of day for pain relief. Use it at night to calm anxiety and alleviate insomnia. People with headaches and cramps also use the relaxing cannabis strain. \n\nFor recreational users, the strain with the distinctive smell of skunk is something to get excited about as it may put you into a spacey state or a euphoric zone. People with all tolerance levels should find something to like in the strain. \n\nThe THC level is above normal at 19 percent and at 2.4 percent, the CBD level is high, making it suitable for the more serious medical conditions such as seizures. People with trouble eating, such as those with chemotherapy-induced nausea, may like this strain as it is known to boost the appetite.\n\nSuper Skunk has not changed much since the early 1990's when it was originally released and it has a reputation for being very strong and potent. Super Skunk has dense, thick buds and is not difficult to grow. \n\nWhen growing indoors one can expect higher than average yields at roughly 15 ounces per square meter and a flowering time between 8 and 9 weeks. Outdoors, this strain is ready for harvest in mid- September with yields just over 21 ounces per square meter.\n\n"

The nugs are dense and the aroma is floral and fruity with a hint of Kush. \n\nLevels of active ingredient Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in Purple Headband are generally around 21 percent but have tested as high as 28 percent.\n\nPurple headband users may feel euphoric and energetic at the same time. One may even experience enhanced sensory perception and an improvement in mood - rendering it a popular medication for ADD, ADHD, PTSD, bipolar depression and other mood-related disorders.\n\nOther effects frequently noted when using this strain are giggly, hungry, relaxed, and/or sleepy. Due to these effects, Purple Headband may come in handy for treating conditions like anxiety, loss of appetite, hyperactivity and irritability. However, the most significant symptom Purple headband relieves is headaches and migraines. \n\nPurple Headband should be grown indoors for best results but can be grown outdoors as well. When grown indoors expect flowering between week 7 and 9. Expect buds to get very large, very quickly around the 6.5 to 7 week mark. When grown outdoors harvest comes in mid-September.

The THC level generally sits at around 20 percent when grown properly with negligible CBD content of roughly 0.2 percent. This strain won 1st place in the 2011 High Times Medical Cannabis Cup Michigan hybrid category.\n\nThe strain is green with crystals and orange hair. The buds are round, dense, and sticky with large trichomes, the appendages on the plant. Sour OG smells like lemon, pine, and gasoline, with a fruity and sweet undertone. Some fans have described the taste as like nothing you have ever tasted before.  \n\nWhen you choose Sour OG, you can expect to feel peaceful and in a good mood. It won’t drag you down and you will still be able to get things done. The high comes on quickly, gets intense, and dissipates after a few hours, when you will wind down and still feel relaxed. \n\nMedicinal users enjoy the strain for its sedative effects. People with pain, depression, anxiety, and stress use Sour OG as it gives a super stoned feeling. Some medical users have said one hit is enough and relieves all pain and worry. Others like it for the munchie effect; people that have trouble eating may find themselves seriously hungry after puffing on Sour OG. \n\nRecreational users think of Sour OG differently. They say it is fast-acting and incites dreamlike mind-blowing effects. They say the strain works well in the head, offering a happy and talkative vibe or a euphoric high. Beginners might want to choose another strain. Sour OG’s super dank smell indicates a potent medicine best served to intermediate or advanced cannabis users who can handle its sedative and euphoric effects. \n\nSour OG grows well indoors and outdoors with an average flowering time of 8 weeks. Indoors, simple hydroponics work well and the plant grows to medium height. The plant’s colas have excellent structure and medium yield.

The THC level ranges between 17 and 24 percent with a neglible CBD at just 0.13 percent. \n\nDNA Genetics, a popular seed company founded in 2004, bred the original Lemon OG by crossing a true Las Vegas Lemon Skunk cut with the OG #18 cut. What resulted was an abnormally high calyx to leaf ratio flower with an uncanny lemony fuely taste and smell. In the ten years since the company’s inception and Lemon OG’s birth, both have been successful, winning plenty of awards. \n\nMostly though, Lemon OG is bred for an unmistakable lemon taste and smell. It is the lemoniest of the crosses being bred, and since users like the lemon, expect the strain to become more lemon and less kush/skunk/diesel, increasing its terpene profile of limonene while phasing out the taste of Kush. Lemon OG may appear to be a paler green than other strains and it may even look yellow. Buds are sticky and the plant has white or orange trichomes, the plant’s appendages. \n\nThe strain’s THC profile makes it suitable for the medicinal patient and the recreational user, but Lemon OG’s smaller CBD profile, like most cannabis strains, is not suitable for some of the more intense disorders like seizures. Strains with higher CBD content have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-anxiety properties. Generally, these CBD-rich strains have over 4 percent CBD.\n\nMedical users like the sedative effect of Lemon OG that helps with appetite and stress. Other uses include bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, and OCD. People undergoing chemotherapy may appreciate the strain for relieving nausea and increasing appetite. \n\nRecreational users rave about the quick-acting psychoactive effects. Some say that the smoke is clear and the strain offers a relaxing, uplifting, and creative experience that begs the user to go out and do something. One person reported that it was a good mid-day experience; his focus improved at first and he got some pain relief later.\n\nYou can get feminized and autoflowering seeds and grow Lemon OG indoors and outdoors.

        "description": "A potent strain with some famous genetics, Animal Cookies -- sometimes also known as Animal Crackers -- is a relatively recent indica hybrid. Bred by Canadian seed bank BC Bud Depot, it is a cross between perennial favorite Girl Scout Cookies and indica hybrid Fire OG. Animal Cookies has definite ÔÇ£bag appealÔÇØ for consumers, with multicolored flowers and a complex sweet-sour scent. It has heavy, almost narcotic indica effects, providing pain relief, relaxation, and sleep. Cannabis lab Analytical 360 has tested samples of Animal Cookies and measured its THC content at between 18% and an impressive 27%.\n\nAnimal Cookies is marked by small to medium-sized popcorn-like buds with a dense bud structure typical of other indicas. Leaves are a yellowish-green; some phenotypes can express subtle purple hues. This purple is brought out when colder temperatures stimulate pigments called anthocyanins -- the process is similar to the way foliage changes color in autumn when chlorophyll breaks down in cooler weather. The buds are very sticky and covered in white to cloudy amber trichomes, perhaps lending the leaves their yellowish appearance. Orange hairs -- which are actually pistils to collect pollen from male plants -- stand out against the colorful flowers. Animal Cookies has a scent that is simultaneously sweet and sour, with a dank, skunky edge. Breaking open the sticky flowers yields some more notes of pepper and pine. Interestingly, this strain is not known for having a grape-like taste; although its pigments bring out purple hues in the right conditions, this does not result in a corresponding change in flavor. When combusted, Animal Cookies have a thick, harsh smoke that often induces coughing. This smoke has a sweet and vaguely spicy taste when exhaled.\n\nAnimal Cookies has a high that settles in fairly quickly for a predominantly indica strain. Smokers may not have finished coughing before theyÔÇÖre hit with a weighty and palpable stoney feeling that affects the entire body. Emotional well-being accompanies this relaxation so that users typically feel remarkably comfortable and contented. Without any cerebral intensity, this strain does not confer the kind of rapid-association thoughtfulness that comes with more pure sativa varieties. The extreme relaxation that Animal Cookies provides can melt into a powerful couchlock if users continue to indulge in its potent bud. These physical effects also make Animal Cookies an effective painkiller with medical application. Those suffering from both mild or more chronic, nerve-based pain report an easing or a total relief of symptoms. This strainÔÇÖs heaviness also makes it an excellent treatment for users who struggle with insomnia. Mentally, Animal Cookies can also be beneficial in helping treat stress and anxiety, as it renders users happily oblivious in its stoney haze. Side effects include the typical dry eyes and dry mouth, along with some appetite stimulation. More recommended for nighttime than daytime use, Animal Cookies is not usually praised for helping users accomplish work.\n\nThis strain can be difficult to grow, and is not recommended for newcomers to cultivation. Better nurtured indoors than out, Animal CookiesÔÇÖ plants tend to be a synthesis of indica and sativa varieties, with plants that grow tall but also have bushy and horizontally-spreading lateral branches. Fortunately, it responds if users bend and trim the stems and branches, growing accordingly to fit the surrounding space. Growers should also be sure to trim any broad fan leaves growing near the top of the plant, so as to allow light and air to circulate to the lower branches and flowering nodes. Animal Cookies reaches the flowering stage within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a higher than average yield. Growers should keep in mind that this is a very pungent strain, even in the vegetative stage, and those looking to keep their operations discreet should put odor control measures in place like carbon air filters. Animal Cookies can be grown as clones, from clippings taken from mature plants; alternatively, seeds of this strain can be purchased online from breeder BC Bud Depot.\n\nWith a well-rounded, hashy taste and a heavy body stone, Animal Cookies has the best of what indica varieties have to offer. Its memorable name, conjuring nostalgia for childhood snacks, also means it is likely to have continued popularity. Strong and enjoyable even for experienced cannabis aficionados, this strain is best enjoyed alone in quiet surroundings or with a small, intimate group of good friends.\n\n"

THC levels in Stardawg are regularly above average - testing between 16 and 22 percent.\n\nPeople remark on the musky, earthy scent with diesel fuel notes. Cannabis lovers appreciate the strong, funky aroma but it may be too strong for novices and first-timers.

Expect the herb to be dense and frosted with resin, so much so that the dark green color with red/orange hairs is hard to see.  \n\nMedical patients choose Stardawg to help manage symptoms of fatigue, stress, and anxiety. It blunts pain, alleviates digestive issues, and inspires the munchies so people can gain weight. Others choose it in order to get to sleep at night or to manage the fallout from Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson's Disease. \n\nBecause it is a Sativa-dominant strain, people with significant medical issues might want to try a different strain with more of a body melt and pain relief. The smoke feel in the mouth is thick and may make some people cough.\n\nPeople should be able to get tasks accomplished, run errands, and even go to work when consuming smaller doses of this strain as it imparts uplifting cerebral effects that can stimulate the mind. Recreational users report highs that feel like spiritual journeys and that may be too intense for newbies.\n\nThis strain is suited for daytime use, especially a wake and bake as the effects last for a long time. Stardawg has a reputation for long buzz times, two to three hours, which is longer than many strains - which need re-application after an hour or two. \n\nGrowers can plant indoors, out of doors, or in a green house.

There are many strains out there with “grape” in the name, but Grape Stomper is one of the originals. \n\nTrue to its name, this strain smells like grape. The fruity aroma is subtle, not strong, which may disappoint some people. The coloring is also not quite as purple as one might expect. The trichomes get in the way of seeing the buds, which are thick with resin and have plentiful orange hairs. \n\nTo smell the bud better, remove it from the bag or bottle and break up the nugs. If you do, you might also get a faint waft of diesel or chemical smell, indicative of Grape Stomper’s parent. You should be able to pick out the grape smell and maybe detect some floral notes. The smoke is light, not dense, which medical users will appreciate, especially if coughing is painful.\n\nLike other hybrids though, after the head rush, a mellow effect settles in the body after a few minutes. People have described the high as bouncy, not the couch-locked reputation of an Indica, although Grape Stomper does have some Indica effects. People can use this strain in the morning or during the day as Grape Stomper helps you remain alert, functional, and social. \n\nEven though Grape Stomper works on the head with its cerebral high, novice users may get bogged down in the body melt. Therefore, due to the potency of the strain, intermediate and advanced cannabis users might be most suited to unlock the strain’s multiple personalities. \n\nNot noted for its strong medical uses, people can still blunt their mild pain or other medical symptoms with this strain. People with mild anxiety or depression may enjoy this strain as will people with headaches and insomnia.\n\nGrowers say that the buds on your plants should be chunky, dark green and purple with crystals. Expect the plant to grow to 3 or 4 feet high and have a high yield. Flowering generally occurs around the 72 day mark. In its true form this strain is available as a clone only. Clones can be purchased by it's breeder, Gage Green Genetics. \n\nA balanced hybrid, Grape Stomper works as mild medicine. Recreational users will appreciate the cerebral effect along with a body mellowing that is good for being social. Try it just to sample the grape aroma!\n\n"

In its true form its a cross between Critical Plus and Jack Herer and tends to carry a THC level of around 20 percent. \n\nCritical Jack is a world traveler and has become highly cultivated in recent years, especially in Europe, and has won some prizes including 1st place in the 2015 San Bernardino Hempcon Cup.\n\nCritical Jack is now widely popular throughout California and much of the West Coast and has the potential, with its full-bodied appearance and robust trichomes, to compete with the best cannabis strains out there.\n\nThe aroma is floral, fruity, and pine smelling. The scent is highly valued with its lemony smell that hits right away followed by the sweet floral aroma - although the floral undernotes often arrise only when the bud is crumbled by hand or crushed in the grinder. \n\nThe smoke is light, not full bodied so medical users may prefer it in order to avoid heavy coughing. People can use this herb in the morning or daytime due to its cerebral, energy and mood boosting effects.\n\nRecreational users will find that the effects are long-lasting. People report that they enjoyed the cerebral effects and found it to be a highly sociable strain. \n\nMedical uses include headaches, depression, anxiety, and appetite stimulation. The pain relieving and anxiety reducing effects are well balanced with a psychoactive push. THC content is above average, but not extremely high. Users can expect to feel good for about two hours and experience an uplifting sensation in the head with a delayed and muted effect in the body.\n\nCritical Jack is a fairly fast growing strain with flowering time between 57-67 days when grown indoors. Outdoors you'll want to get started in mid-April with harvest time in late-September or early October. Yields are well above average with fat nugs that can drastically weight down a plant in its final weeks.\n\n"

The high is long lasting and some people might find themselves couch-locked. Some have said that it is the best couchlock strain on the planet.\n\nDue to the high THC content and modest amount of CBD, Pineapple Chunk is a favorite of medical patients as it alleviates strong pain. While many strains that are potent enough to blunt pain also help with insomnia, Pineapple Chunk delivers a head high as well, possibly adding to paranoia and anxiety making it unsuitable for people with anxiety and depression in high doses. \n\nThe plant grows quickly and can flower in 60 days when indoors. The plant is stable, strong, and proliferates well under the right conditions; good for a first time grower. You can grow it indoors, outdoors, or in the greenhouse as it is extremely mold/disease resistant. \n\nPineapple Chunk was developed at Barney's Farm, which now sells the strain in an autoflowering variety - incorporating ruderalis into its lineage.\n\n"

The rapper and Colorado-based RiverRock company are marketing the strain as one with a relaxing but energizing effect. Khalifa sometimes shortens the strain name to KK.\n\nMr. Khalifa joins Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson, Melissa Etheridge and others in marketing cannabis products and customized strains. The cannabis industry is expanding its partnerships with celebrities so consumers can expect more branded strains like Khalifa Kush in the near future.\n\nSan Francisco dispensary, the Cookie Co. 415, first made Khalifa Kush popular. Wiz Khalifa said it took years to develop the rare phenotype of OG Kush. They started from seed, with Khalifa personally testing the product, eventually giving his blessing. Genetics are still top secret, and legend has it that the real Khalifa Kush is much stronger than found at the dispensaries, and reserved just for Wiz.\n\nThe taste and smell are like OG Kush, but Khalifa wanted it bred for a lemony flavor and pine notes, not earthy traits, although the weed retains undertones of a pungent smell. \n\nThe strain is known for its stimulating effects, making it perfect for a wake and bake session or a midday session. Breeders designed the strain for uplifting cerebral effects accompanied by a relaxing body effect. The effect on the body is without heavy sedation, which should appeal to recreational users along with the high THC content. Lightweights and new users should use caution with this potent herb. \n\nThe lack of strong sedation makes the strain suitable for mild and moderate medical conditions such as fatigue, stress, anxiety, and depression while the high CBD is good for more serious conditions. Medical patients may also like the strain due to its reported smooth smoke that may irritate the throat less than other strains.  \n\nKhalifa Kush buds are small or medium sized, green with orange hairs, dense, and full of resin. When seeds are available, because it is a phenotype of OG Kush, grow it indoors, outside, or in a greenhouse. The plant is bushy and produces a lot of bud. Prune the plant for maximum growth that may be ready for harvest in 60 days.\n\n"

Originally bred in the early 2000's it has built a reputation for a unique look and routinely high potency.\n\nWhite crystals blanket the plant like snow on its barrel-shaped, tight buds. The smell is diesel fuel and earthy. Some have detected pepper and lemon in the taste while others have said it's more sweet, musky, and oaky. \n\nAlthough it tilts towards the Indica side, Wifi OG has cerebral effects, offering energy and focus. The heady profile also means that people can use it in the morning and midday and not get too sleepy. For recreational users, this herb may be suited to creative and social activities.\n\nBecause of the high THC and the low CBD, Wifi OG is not suited for medical patients with serious disorders like epilepsy. Instead, people with depression, anxiety, appetite loss, and pain find that it suits their needs. Some may find the smoke a bit harsh on the intake, which may not be suitable for people trying to avoid coughing due to pain or lung irritation.\n\nThe first rush is strong and uplifting and people have reported 3-hour highs with this particular strain of weed. Some have mentioned a localized feeling in the face and eyes that is warm and pleasant.  \n\nThe home grower will find different phenotypes of Wifi OG on the market which stay true to the strain’s profile in various degrees. For example, you may find plants with traditional barrel-shaped nugs - staying true to its original genetics - or a more conical shape, which recent breeders have begun cultivating. The aroma and taste may vary slightly as well and is continuously being improved upon. It was this type of genetic variation in cannabis that has spurred celeberties like Wiz Khalifa to develop their own brand of Kush - see Khalifa Kush.\n\nA high-yield plant, Wifi OG grows inside and out but performs best when grown in a controlled environment using the Sea of Green (SOG) technique or a Screen of Green (SCROG) set up. Keep pH levels between 5.7 - 6.0 for best results. When grown indoors expect flowering at 65 days.\n\n"

Either way it is Sativa-dominant (65/35 Sativa) just like Green Crack with similar THC content, reaching 24 percent, and CBD content of roughly 1 percent.\n\nA cross between Northern Lights and Skunk #1, Green Goblin has legendary parents. The buds are very distinctive, fat and covered with lots of orange hair. The aroma is – well – skunky. Another way to say it is earthy or musky and some versions may have a diesel aroma. When you smoke it, you may taste mango/papaya.\n\nStrongly influenced by Sativa, most people will feel uplifted, happy, dreamy, energetic, and creative. After the head buzz stabilizes, people generally get a bit of a body melt that helps them relax. The high THC and the sativa effects should go over well with recreational users who want to get blazed but not take a weed nap.\n\nWithout much CBD in this strain, medical users who need strong relief should look for another strain. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms should find that Green Goblin appreciates their pain and can sympathize. He’s no comic book character when it comes to helping with your insomnia, appetite, anxiety, or stress. \n\nSome medical patients have commented on side effects such as dry mouth and dry eyes. Less common reports include a little paranoia and dizziness, which is to be expected when you fire up the brain with strong weed. One doctor commented that Green Goblin makes people “extremely” energetic to the point of “bouncing off the wall.” \n\nTo grow this strain, let your fingers dance on the keyboard and you will find many online seed vendors. If you want a clone, find it on the West Coast mostly. Green Goblin is very easy to grow so beginners – go for it. It flowers faster than many other cannabis varieties, in 49 to 55 days.\n\nThe plant does not need much attention, except trimming at the bottom and pruning at the top for best results at harvest time. In colder temperature environments, Green Goblin may turn into Purple Goblin.  \n\nWeed breeders seem to like comic book characters and the Green Goblin was a likely choice when saying Green Crack just didn’t feel right. Choose this strain if you want to feel really peppy, like cleaning the house peppy or running across America like Forest Gump peppy. High in THC, rec users should flock to the Green guy while med users enjoy the Green man’s sedation.\n\n"

The nugs are small to medium-sized, and the colors are muted and toned down, with light green, purple, and orange. Trichomes and resin are minimal. The fragrance is sweet and floral in the nose and finishes smooth and tasty in the mouth.  \n\nWith a high CBD content, Purple Arrow may help in reversing alcohol damage to the brain, stop cancer from advancing, alleviate severe social anxiety, and serve as an anti-psychotic. You can purchase the bud to smoke, but other products are available with high CBD content such as oil, tincture, and lotion.\n\nPeople can expect to feel immediate pain relief, effective for mild, moderate, and severe pain. Along with pain relief, Purple Arrow delivers heavy sedation so you might want to use it at night. Euphoria is possible as the strain does have some sativa. \n\nRecreational users who are looking for an average psychoactive experience could choose this strain as well. Don’t expect to go out and change the world; a mellow day on the couch is more likely to happen. The couch-lock shouldn’t be too overwhelming and you could try – at least once – a strain high in CBD in order to experience the synergistic effect the THC and CBD have working together. \n\nPurple Arrow is available in seeds and clones. It grows to about three feet tall and is sort of skinny. Flowering may occur in 45 to 60 days. A low yielding strain, you may be able to push it with selective light training, experimenting with different lighting systems. Blue lights have been shown to increase yield. Get the light close to the stem so the leaves don’t grow downwards. \n\nPurple Arrow is a high-CBD strain that medical patients should definitely try for serious conditions and symptoms. For Rec users, it has a decent amount of THC, and the high CBD content may provide a synergistic effect that you haven’t felt before. This potent strain will drop you on the couch and leave you there, pain-free and happy.\n\n"

While the CBD is low, the mostly Indica effects work well for medical patients and recreational consumers who want to zone out and become zombies - the relaxed kind of course, not the “gonna eat your brain” kind.\n\nThe OG strains are very popular in California where a simple formula has brought great results. Since the 1990s, breeders have taken a strain and crossed it with OG Kush, developing the genetics over time and producing reliable and potent strains. These strains are distinguished from others due to their terpene profile, which characteristically includes caryophyllene and myrcene, giving it the familiar floral and diesel aroma. \n\nZombie OG is dank bud with a multi-dimensional flavor profile. Aromas such as pine, earth, and lavender tease the nose and delight the palate. Buds are on the small side. They are dense and bright green with orange hairs. White trichomes and resin are plentiful. \n\nRecreational users can expect a couch-locking experience as the weed hits the body hard with sedation and sleepiness. You may feel some euphoria in the head while the body says not now, later. One way to use this strain is for introspection - lay on the bank of a river and contemplate your existence and then go home and have the best sleep of your life!\n\nDeep and peaceful sleep is the promise to medical patients as well as a pain-free existence. People with stress, depression, insomnia, and anxiety will all find something to like in Zombie OG. People suffering from wasting diseases or undergoing chemotherapy may find that they are much more likely to visit the fridge or cupboard for some delicious munchies. \n\nZombie OG is not one of the easiest seeds or plants to find. Search for relatives like Zombie Kush or others in the Zombie or OG family. Grow it indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. This plant yields high in the harvest with dense buds. Novice growers can attempt it. Expect average height plants and flowering in 9 weeks, which is a bit longer than other cannabis strains. \n\nNamed for the zombie-like state this strain will put you in, Zombie OG is a favorite of recreational and medical users that just happen to be in the market for a peaceful weed coma.\n\n"

It is tropical and fruity but also a little sour and has hints of diesel fuel and pine. It’s one of the most aromatic strains around. Buds are dense and sticky with resin. The nugs are mostly green with a smattering of orange hairs.\n\nA balanced strain, recreational users should feel confident in partaking of Golden Pineapple at any time of day. The main effect is energy as the THC infuses the brain and body with its peppy effect. Expect to feel good, vigorous, and come down without feeling groggy.\n\nWith THC levels so high though, you might want to try it in a safe place and get to know its special effects. Or, you can measure your dose. Take a hit and stop. Wait a little while, maybe a half hour and see if another hit is in your best interest. You can always dose more, but you can’t un-dose; just wait for the effects to dissipate.\n\nMedical users can also take advantage of its creative and uplifting effects while managing pain or other symptoms of a medical condition. Escape from depression, stress, and anxiety – at least for a little while. The low CBD level makes this strain not right for severe medical issues. It can, however, ease pain, improve appetite, and help you get a good night’s sleep.\n\nThis strain grows in an average amount of time, about 60 days from planting until you can cut, cure, and indulge. One grower detected a grapefruit smell as his plants were growing and at harvest, it developed the characteristic fruit, diesel, and pine aroma. Upon curing, he noticed that the pineapple smell finally made its appearance.\n\nBalanced and tipping towards a Sativa, Golden Pineapple is a popular, award winning hybrid with notable parents. With a multi-level aromatic profile, this strain is sure to please people who like a strong scent on their bud. Recreational users choose it for the high THC levels and medical users enjoy the energetic push that also alleviates their symptoms.\n\n"

Patients with less severe conditions also use this strain.Because of its higher CBD content, ACDC might be helpful for edible bakers who want to minimize the risk of intense side effects. \n\nAn early study at New York University's Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center studied a preparation of CBD in an agent called Epidiolex. Investigators found that the drug was safe, well-tolerated, and effective.\n\nDue to the balance in Sativa/Indica, which may edge towards a Sativa, users should feel an uplifting effect including euphoria, peace, and happiness. You may feel more focused and more sociable. Some have described the sensation as completely relaxing without a worry on the horizon.\n\nGrowers can expect a bushy plant with thin, feathery leaves that may grow as high as four feet.

The leaves may turn a bit purple and the nugs are about the size of a thumb.\n\nFlowering happens in 9 to 10 weeks, longer in colder environments.

They have orange hairs and a generous sprinkling of crystals. Nugs should have a diesel smell mixed with citrus. Properly cured, the buds are slightly resinous and not dry. When you break it apart or put it in the grinder, you might smell pine or spicy notes. The smoke may feel a bit harsh and diesel fuel-like.\n\nA balanced strain, recreational users should find body melt and euphoria. Mostly likely though, due to the high THC, recreational users will get blazed - potentially to the point of paranoia. You may feel joy and experience daydreaming as well. Depending on the mood you were in before, you may feel introspective but more in touch with your body, and altogether very relaxed and hungry.\n\nMedical users with mild to moderate conditions should appreciate Tres Dawg’s medicinal profile. The CBD is lower than strains intended specifically for medical uses but Tres Dawg should make good medicine as the sedative effects synergize with the cerebral effects. However, if you have appointments outside the house, be careful of the high THC that may be hallucinatory or disorienting, depending on your condition and other medications.\n\nMost people should find that Tres Dawg introduces itself with a little euphoria; you’ll smile. The cerebral head rush will dissipate, leaving you with a little introspection. When the brain has had a chance to acclimate, you’ll notice that you’re a little spacey and have no pain. If you’re close to bedtime, your body might accept a more sedative effect, couch-locking you until you drop into a deep slumber.\n\nTres Dawg is a reliable growing partner as it flourishes indoors and outdoors. Some growers suggest removing most of the fan leaves for better air movement and light penetration. Under the right conditions, you should be able to get a high yield with structured colas and buds.\n\nTres Dawg is among the elite in cannabis with high-placed parents, high THC, and high yield for growers.

Try and set yourself some tasks, particularly of a creative nature, and see what this herb helps you do. \n\nMedical users with severe conditions should look for another strain due to Sour Jack’s very low CBD level. However, as half indica, this strain will have some body effects that may alleviate mild anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The energetic effects of the weed may also help medical users climb out of lethargy or depression and get active again. \n\nA rare strain and difficult for growers to find, check Karma Genetics first. Grow it indoors or outdoors and expect the plants to grow tall and flower in about ten weeks, which is a little longer than most cannabis strains but worth it due to the high yield it offers. \n\nOne home grower shared some tips for growing Sour Jack indoors. For soil, try four parts Fox Farm Ocean Forest and one part Perlite. In extra nutrients, choose Grow Big for the vegetative phase but you shouldn’t need too much. Use Tiger Bloom in the flowering stage and keep temperatures in the low 70s for best results. Yields are generally above average.\n\n"

        "description": "Purple Rhino is an Indica-heavy hybrid, achieved by crossing White Rhino and Mendocino Purps. This strain features THC that is above average at 17 to 20 percent and average CBD content of around 1 percent. This herb is best suited to recreational use and select mild or moderate medical conditions. Both of Purple Rhino’s parents have won awards as far back as the late 1990s.\n\nThe buds of Purple Rhino are big and noticeably purple with green undertones and orange hairs. The aroma is sweet and fruity with a lemonberry accent and it may smell a bit like skunk and fuel. One person commented that it smells like turpentine and grape juice. Others have said that the smell is multi-dimensional and cannot be described. The purple appearance though, makes this strain stand out as one of the more flamboyant cannabis strains.\n\nExpect a high that is both cerebral and calming due to the heavy indica influence. You can partake at any time of day as this strain is not noted for a weed coma effect. Recreational users will find a lot to like in this strain especially if you’re looking for a body melt. \n\nMedical users with mild to moderate symptoms can use this weed for conditions like anxiety, depression, and insomnia. It has a strong munchie effect and may help improve appetite. You should feel calmer, more relaxed, have your mild pain relieved, and drift off to sleep with ease. Purple Rhino is not recommended for seizure disorders due to the low CBD content.  \n\nThe effects should happen in a few minutes with a very heavy high that hits the head and disperses into the body. The high should last at full force for a couple hours, at which time you may need to re-medicate. \n\nPurple Rhino plants are short and stout and it flowers in 55 to 60 days on average, although some have harvested in 46 days. The leaves are green and the buds present their purple color right away. Some generations have deeper purple tones and larger, denser buds. Yield always depends on conditions but Purple Rhino is known to have a medium or high yield. \n\n"

A 50/50 balanced or slightly Indica-dominant strain, Rainbow Kush has slightly above average THC at 17 percent and average CBD of 1 percent. \n\nSeveral breeders have attempted to perfect this strain. Dutch growers, Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds (AMS), state that they achieved their version of the Rainbow Kush strain by crossing Master Kush and Hindu Kush. Lifetime Seeds from Spain created theirs by crossing Dancehall with Blueberry. \n\nWhen you go to purchase this strain, you might be lured by marketing claims by the breeder, “It’s the most colorful strain ever invented in looks and flavor.” If you look at images on websites or magazines, you will definitely find pictures of rainbow colored cannabis, and those pictures are amazing. However, in real life, this bud may not look like those enhanced images or measure up to the marketing claims. \n\nWhat you will find is cannabis that does look different than other strains. You’ll find purple, orange/red, white, and green in large patches. Crystals are generously sprinkled and it should be pretty sticky to the touch. Rainbow Kush is known for its pine smell, but you may also smell Skunk. Some may detect notes of coffee and a spicy aftertaste. \n\nRecreational users who want to get a little stoned but still be active and/or social should check out this strain as it won’t put you in a weed coma. The Indica influence should induce a mild body melt accompanied by positive cerebral effects. You could partake in the morning or during the day due to the relatively low THC level and mild body effects. \n\nMedical patients may utilize Rainbow Kush to alleviate nausea, poor appetite, and pain among other conditions. The CBD content is too low for seizure disorders but higher than some other strains, making it suitable for washing away anxieties, aches, and pains without the extreme high found in other strains. \n\nGrow Rainbow Kush indoors or outdoors. The breeder states that it is easy or moderately difficult to grow. Some growers suggest propagating the plant in a Sea of Green (SOG) style, which forces the flowering stage earlier. Under regular conditions, it flowers in nine weeks and produces a yield outdoors of up to 750 grams or 26.5 ounces per sq. meter. When you grow the plant, you may see the bright colors that breeders, marketers, and aficionados rave about.\n\n"

This strain is a cross between Sour Diesel, NYC Diesel, and a local California variety, Ferrari. \n\nThe THC is low at 10 percent and the CBD is very high at 11 to 13 percent and some concentrates may have CBD as high as 30 percent. Sour Tsunami is one of the first to become famous for high CBD. \n\nThis strain is known for its distinctive smell - sweet and diesel fuel. Some may notice a chocolate aroma. On exhaling, you may detect a bitter or sour smell, hence the name. The buds are green, some lighter hued than others, and tinged with purple. \n\nRecreational users that are accustomed to average or high THC levels might pass this one by. Those that are used to the weed from days gone by and feel that the current strains are too strong, might want to try it. Others may want to experience the synergistic effect that equal parts THC and CBD produce as different cannabinoids interact with the body in individual ways. \n\nMedical users should definitely check it out due to the very high CBD level. It will alleviate pain, without making you really high and incapacitated on the couch. Lawrence Ringo of Southern Humboldt Seed Collective created this strain to treat his own back pain, which he says disappears in 15 minutes after indulging in Sour Tsunami. \n\nConventional medical studies have found that CBD alleviates seizure disorders and works on alcoholism and cancer. People with less severe medical conditions such as insomnia, stress, and nausea could also try Sour Tsunami. Some also find CBD to be helpful when treating acne and other skin ailments. Whatever the reason, you will gain symptom relief while keeping a clear head. \n\nGrow this strain and you will have flowers in 9 weeks that smell sweet and musky. Like many CBD-rich strains, producing bud with high-CBD is not a given. In fact, you’ll only have a 25 percent chance of getting to that level. To increase your chances, work on variety in your strains and source. Buy seeds and cuttings of a few different CBD-rich strains. \n\nTo increase your chances, use a testing service like Pure Analytics to test the seedlings at 3 to 4 weeks, before the flowering stage. Take a couple of nodes from the top of the plant, dry them out, and send for testing. Once you identify which plants are high in CBD, you can take cuttings to develop right away.\n\n"

The buds are on the smaller side and not super dense. The color is medium green with bright orange/red hairs and a sprinkling of crystals. The aroma is berries, pine, and some skunk. Some may detect notes of earth, citrus, or licorice.\n\nThe Goji berries are also known as wolfberries. They are packed with nutrients and are becoming known as a superfood. Due to their complex nature, their flavor profile is multi-dimensional, as Goji OG is designed to be, an aromatic medley of flavors.  \n\nRecreational users find the high THC attractive. The psychoactive effect will show up early, often after the initial head rush and slight body melt. Pass this one by if you’re a novice user as it may be too strong. Otherwise, hit it gently and check yourself before you wreck yourself.\n\nFor medical users, the CBD content is too low for major seizure disorders and cancer. However, the synergistic effect between the cannabinoids may be enough to help with anxiety, stress, mild pain, and other conditions. Due to the Sativa-dominance, you should be able to indulge at any time of day and not have to take a weed nap.\n\nBodhi Seeds offers regular photoperiod seeds to grow indoors, outdoors, or in a greenhouse. You should see tall plants, flowers in 9 weeks, and obtain a high yield. Their newer seeds are reported to have stronger stems so no staking is required. \n\nWhen it flowers, expect the buds to be wrapped around the main stem and not on the smaller branches.

Some are Indica-dominant and some are Sativa-dominant. A cross between Black Cherry Soda and Space Queen, THC levels range between 17 and 20 percent and the CBD level is about 0.4 percent.\n\nBred by TGA Seeds, this strain is colorful with purple dominating the large buds, accented by orange hairs, nice crystals, and ample resin. The taste is one of berries - blackberries, blueberries, raspberries. The smoke is full-bodied and goes down easily, tasting sweet enough to partake in all day.\n\nRecreational users choose this strain if they want to feel good without getting trippy and locked to the couch. The balanced profile will produce a cerebral high while the body melt creeps in slowly.\n\nMedical users with severe conditions should find another strain, one rich in CBD, anywhere from 3 to 10 percent. Patients with mild to moderate conditions will enjoy the body melt and mild sedation of Plushberry, accompanied by a low-level high that won’t interfere with the day to day.\n\nPeople grow this strain in and out and also in the greenhouse. Indoors, it does well in a hydroponic system. It should grow relatively tall and be densely populated with purple accented leaves. Plushberry has a couple of phenotypes – one will grow as mentioned – tall, while another grows smaller and bushier. Some growers report that clones do not grow as tall as the mother plant.\n\nExpect to see some vibrant colors among the leaves and buds, colors like pink, purple, and yellow. The flowering period begins at 55 to 60 days, below average for cannabis plants. With proper care, expect a medium to heavy yield.

Instead, enjoy the cerebral effects that help you focus and the body effects that help you relax. \n\nYou may find a lack of a ceiling on the high. In another words, you can keep getting higher and higher, unlike other strains that plateau and more hits don’t equal more high. This effect may be due to the genetics or the ratio of cannabinoids in this strain. \n\nMedical users could choose this strain to alleviate mild or moderate conditions such as anxiety, stress, or depression. With low CBD levels though, choose another strain to alleviate seizure disorders. It also helps with insomnia, mild pain, and lack of appetite. Side effects, like other cannabis strains, include dry eyes and mouth. Paranoia, dizziness, and disorientation may occur.\n\nNot an especially popular strain, people may find it difficult to find in bud, and even more difficult to find in seeds or clones. If and when you are ready to grow this strain, expect flowers in 9-10 weeks, often earlier. The yield is considered good and the plant clones easily. \n\nGrowers consider it reliable but not top-shelf. On the first try, you may find one main cola that is thick with few side branches. Not a heavy feeder, Cherry AK-47 may grow really tall with really fat colas that turn purple in an outdoor, late harvest. This strain grows at altitude, such as the 5,000 to 15,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.\n\n"

A California variety, it has been difficult to find elsewhere, but that is changing as more dispensaries across the country discover Blue Champagne’s appeal.\n\nThe aroma of this strain makes it stand out. One whiff of the buds will fill your nostrils with the taste of – champagne. Leave the bag or jar open and the room will soon smell like a winery. Other aromatic characteristics include caramelized sugar, fruit, and earth. Small buds with red hairs are very resinous, full of crusty trichromes, making it suitable for hash-making.\n\nRecreational users should appreciate the Sativa-dominance. Blue Champagne offers a cerebral effect like mood boosts, sociability, and energy. This strain is suitable for morning and daytime use due to it uplifting effects. The THC level is above average but not off the charts, so it won’t put you into outer space. \n\nSome have reported that this strain is very potent, despite the slightly above average THC level. This effect may be due to the Sativa-dominance or to the synergistic effect of the terpene profile. The high should hit quickly and linger, leaving the user high, not sleepy, and motivated and inspired. \n\nBlue Champagne’s Indica side offers medical patients effective sedation. People with migraines, pain, and headaches may find some relief often found from narcotics in conventional medicine. The CBD content is too low to recommend for serious conditions like seizure disorders. Side effects are typical of medicinal cannabis – dry mouth and a little paranoia.\n\nGrowing Blue Champagne is not difficult as you can grow it indoors and outdoors. It flowers in 9 to 10 weeks, so not the fastest growing variety, but not the slowest. Growers say that flowering buds are lightly structured and that it’s a great plant for cloning. \n\n"

The smoke is full-bodied and creates an impression on the lungs.\n\nBlue Widow provides recreational users with a relaxing, cerebral high. The relatively low THC content makes for a pleasant journey and not a psychoactive, trippy one. This strain will relieve your tension but allow you to get on with your duties or studies. \n\nMedical users find this strain to be helpful in alleviating symptoms such as pain, loss of appetite, and insomnia. It helps with headache, cramps, and muscle pulls. While not high in CBD, it does help chemotherapy patients become more comfortable after treatment, relieving nausea. Patients may appreciate this strain if they want some mild symptom relief, while remaining alert and focused.\n\nFrom Dinafem Seeds, Blue Widow plants have heavy trichrome development and a high yield. The flowering buds come on slowly at first until one day, the orange hairs explode in growth. They cover the blue-hued, dense bud clusters and compete with the trichromes for attention. The buds may show excellent color development with purple and blue. Fan leaves may turn dark purple with black and yellow.\n\nOutdoors, the plant may display great flexibility in coloring, displaying muted, warmer autumnal colors like orange and red and then shift into the colder hues of purple and blue, depending on the temperature. \n\nFeminized seeds are available from Dinafem and others to grow indoors or outdoors. Inside, the plant should flower in 50 to 55 days. Outside, you can harvest usually in early to mid-October. The indoor yield averages 525 g/m2 and the outdoor yield averages 1100 g/plant.\n\nThe yield numbers are the official figures given by Dinafem, the breeder and seed supplier. However, home growers often have a different way of describing things. For instance, the yield for Blue Widow has been described as “2 lbs. per light” and “1 to 10 grams per bud.” Your yield will depend on your experience and equipment and the quality of your seeds or clones.\n\n"

The buds are medium-sized and dense with plenty of trichromes that almost makes the nugs look white. The smoke is smooth and won’t make you cough too much.\n\nWhile Green Ribbon is a balanced hybrid, 50 percent Sativa and 50 percent Indica, the main effects are on the Sativa side.

Either way, the effects are powerful.\n\nGreen Ribbon’s genetics are top-notch and help medical users to lose their worries. Despite the low CBD, Green Ribbon is becoming known as extremely helpful to medical patients due to its well-rounded terpene profile.\n\nMedical patients will appreciate the sedative effects of this strain as it helps alleviate symptoms such as pain and headache. Green Ribbon is also suitable for people with the more psychological type of disorders such anxiety, depression, ADHD, and PTSD. With low CBD, this strain is not noted for its abilities to alleviate major disorders such as seizures or Parkinson’s.\n\nGreen Ribbon is known as more of an outdoor variety but people do grow it inside as well. As a local California breed, people in other areas had some trouble finding bud, seeds, and clones. That situation is slowly changing. However, people seeking seeds or clones may find that supply and demand is not on their side, and they have to pay a premium price for Green Ribbon. In the cost-benefit analysis, this strains balanced and potent profile is probably worth the extra money.\n\nSome growers have shared their tips for growing this herb. You can follow in their path and use the Lollipop method or the Scrog method to grow this weed. Remove the lower leaves from the canopy to allow the colas on top to get the most nutrition.

Part Indica, this strain is also noted for its ability to induce sleep and reduce stress. It is noted for stomach problems and eye disorders as well.\n\nPatients seeking to get out of the house and get social with their friends, might want to try Purple Elephant. This strain is not noted for its sedative effect and with a low CBD, not suited for serious disorders. Downsides include a heavy smoke that may cause coughing and dry mouth.\n\nPurple Elephant is available in clones, although you may find limited quantities. Growers advise that if the environment is too hot, it won’t turn purple. That means most outdoor environments are out.\n\nGrow it indoors and you can control how tall or bushy it gets. You can top it in the early stages and prune the lower branches aggressively in order to optimize top colas and other bud sites. The plant grows fast with a minimal vegetative stage and achieves large colas.\n\nPurple Elephant likes its nutrients but it eats a lot without producing a high yield, but since it is a niche or connoisseur plant, the yield is satisfactory. Some people get tricked in the early stages as the resin builds up. Wait a little longer for more trichromes before harvesting.\n\n"

Most likely, it will start with a head buzz that feels happy and energetic, erasing any bad mood you might be having. As the positive feeling builds, the body melt may creep in and offer a mild sedative effect. \n\nChemdawg Sour Diesel’s body buzz offers deep relaxation to medical patients. People with stress, depression, insomnia, and mild pain should appreciate the sedation. However, with low CBD, this strain is not suitable for the serious seizure disorders. Patients could try this medication in the morning or midday to see if the body melt overrides the clear and energized high.\n\nYou can grow Chemdawg Sour Diesel at home, in your garden, home, or greenhouse. The child of legendary strains, you should be able to find reliable seeds and clones. Growers have said that heat easily affects the plant, which may make it more suitable for an indoor grow.

It is a cross between a Skunk strain and California Orange. The THC level is 19 to 22 percent and the CBD level is 0.09 percent. This strain wins over and over again at the Cannabis Cups - one time winning 10 prizes in 10 months. \n\nWith its citrus heritage, Tangie has a refreshing and sweet aroma like tangerines, distinguishing it from the other citrusy or fruity strains, mostly lemon or grape. Expect some Skunk scent and taste due to its lineage. The light green buds are small and compact, have orange hairs, and are covered by frosty trichromes.\n\nHeavily influenced by Sativa, Tangie gives recreational users the uplifting effects they are looking for. Cerebral characteristics include euphoria, creativity, focus, and happiness. The THC level is above average making it more suitable for the intermediate or advanced user.\n\nFor medical users, the herb is versatile due to its balanced nature. Try it for its sedative effect that may alleviate pain, stress, depression, and insomnia. Some have reported that it is good munchie herb; use it for digestive problems, lack of appetite, and nausea. Side effects of dry mouth and bloodshot eyes are typical for cannabis products. Due to the low CBD content, try a CBD-rich strain instead for serious medical disorders. \n\nTangie is most prevalent on the West Coast, Arizona, and Colorado but you may find clones in other areas. Seeds are available from DNA Genetics, Tangie’s breeder, in regular photoperiod and autoflowering. The plants will grow tall, seriously pursuing height until the 5th week. When the flowers arrive, expect very resinous buds with a dynamic aroma of tangerines. \n\nBecause of its height needs and other considerations, the breeder recommends growing Tangie outside and you will have super resinous herb on your hands in late September or early October. Use the SCROG method of growing and/or liberally top the plants to make a bushy shape that produces better. If you are growing indoors, use soil and not hydroponics. \n\nAnother way to grow this strain, as some growers in California are, is to use veganic cultivation. This process eliminates nutrients made from animal by-products. Nutrients derived from plants leave no residue in the soil, allowing the cannabis plant to feed from the soil more naturally and end up tasting better and producing more. You can also add microbial innoculants (microbes) to optimize plant health.\n\n"

        "description": "Blueberry is a popular, flavor-forward indica hybrid with a strong genetic backbone. It is a three-way cross between an indica Afghani parent and sativa Thai and Purple Thai variant parents. Blueberry was originally developed in the 1970s or 80s by DJ Short, a mysterious but prolific breeder who’s been dubbed the \"Willy Wonka of pot.” Blueberry is distinguished by an unmistakable fresh blueberry smell and taste that have made it an enduring favorite. Blueberry is popular nationwide. It won top marks in the 2000 High Times Cannabis Cup for Best Indica and best strain overall. Blueberry has a THC content that ranges between 15% and 24%.\n\nFlowers of this strain are small and densely-packed, as one might expect of an indica-dominant variety. The compact forest green leaves are often flecked with traces of purple and red. These latter colors develop due to high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins in this strain’s genetics -- as the plants are exposed to colder than average temperatures during the growing period, these pigments are activated, bringing out colorful hues. The leaves are coated in almost transparent trichomes, which may be harder to see than that milky or amber-colored glands covering similarly resinous strains. Nevertheless, buds of Blueberry are very sticky and may be difficult to break up by hand without the use of a grinder. This strain’s bag appeal isn’t just limited to its eye-catching hues -- when cured properly, the flowers immediately give off an aroma of fresh blueberries. This sweet and slightly tart smell bears some resemblance to the odor of the Purple Thai parent strain. Breaking open buds of Blueberry gives off some more complex scents of spice and musk, reminiscent of Afghani varieties. When buds are directly combusted, some skunkiness is evident. Smoke is surprisingly smooth for an indica, and has a sweet blueberry taste on inhale and exhale with no lingering funk.\n\nOften described as a “one hit and quit” strain, Blueberry is notably potent, even for experienced cannabis enthusiasts. Users are quickly struck with a sense of physical heaviness that may be disorienting in situations that require mobility or coordination. In relaxed settings, this physical sensation can translate into a therapeutic calmness, allowing users to unwind after a long day or week of work. The sativa genetics confer some slight mental effects, but these take the form of euphoric uplift more than of cerebral thoughtfulness; smokers may feel chatty or even giggly. In high enough doses, Blueberry will leave users heavy and couchlocked -- this is not an ideal strain for productivity and is better suited to tranquil evening use. Medically speaking, Blueberry has almost narcotic properties. It is of use to those with pain conditions -- both short-term pain due to injury or exercise or long-term chronic pain related to disease or nerve damage. It can also help relieve some of the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety and PTSD, creating a physical relaxation strong enough to ease a racing, pre-occupied mind. Most notably, Blueberry can induce a deep and lasting sleep and therefore serve as an antidote to entrenched insomnia. Side effects of this strain include the typical dry mouth and red eyes. Its heaviness can also result in droopy, unfocused eyes. As noted, a little bit of Blueberry goes a long way and its high is said to last longer than average.\n\nBlueberry can be grown as a clone, if clippings are taken from mature and healthy plants. Growers can also buy seeds. Creator DJ Short has legal claim to the “ancestral and parental breeding stock and intellectual development rights” -- but the nature of the cannabis market is such that DJ Short has no control over his seeds once they’ve been sold, meaning that competitors like Dutch Passion are free to experiment with Blueberry’s genetics and sell their own proprietary seeds under the same name.\n\nBlueberry can be grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing demands restrictive conditions like moderate humidity and consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants are well-suited to indoor cultivation, as they grow short and bushy -- rarely exceeding 3.5 feet in height -- with strong lateral branching. They also have a very favorable leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that they require minimal trimming of broad fan leaves. Growers looking to bring out the vibrant lavender to red accents in Blueberry’s leaves should artificially “shock” the plant by introducing cold temperatures late in vegetative stage, just before flowering.  Plants flowers within 8 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in mid October outdoors. When mature, Blueberry has a moderate to high yield, offering about 1.5 ounces of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nPerfect for mellow nighttime use, Blueberry is a great choice for those looking to unwind alone or with an intimate group of familiar friends. Its combination of restorative physical relaxation with a mildly hazy head high is matched by standout flavors. Blueberry's enviable genetics have been used to crossbreed popular strains like Blue Dream and Blueberry Kush.\n\n"

        "description": "An original “landrace” strain native to the mountains of Afghanistan, Afghani is a pure indica prized for its potency and sturdy genetics. Perfected and balanced over centuries by both natural selection and human cultivation, this vintage variety was likely brought to the west before Afghanistan banned cannabis production in 1973 under pressure from the Nixon administration. Afghani has been used to breed popular child strains like Northern Lights and Blueberry, both Cannabis Cup winners. In the frenzied market for new crossbred strains, this building block strain - also known as Afghani #1 - can be harder to come by.  THC content is high at 15 to 20% and the CBD level is 0.6%.\n\nCured Afghani buds are pale to medium green with a preponderance of orange hairs and a thick coating of trichomes. They should be very resinous and tacky to the touch. This is a famously pungent strain: Afghani nugs have a skunky, diesel-like odor with notes of citrus. The earthy notes are intensified when buds are ground or broken open. As with many indicas, smoke is harsh and thick and can hang in the back of the throat, inducing coughing.\n\nBecause it’s a pure indica, recreational users of Afghani can expect a deep body high and a general pervasive relaxation. Some users report appetite stimulation as well. Plan on nighttime consumption, either alone or with good friends, as this strain tends towards heavy couchlock and sleepiness. \n\nMedicinal effects flow from these same sedative properties. Afghani’s mellow euphoria is useful in the treatment of anxiety and PTSD. The almost narcotic bodily effects can also be used to relieve chronic pain. Above all, this strain is prized for its ability to relieve insomnia and promote deep sleep.   \n\nAfghani’s high comes on like a wave, gradually rolling over you and easing you into a weighty calm. Mental effects are present, but slight, manifesting more as spacey contentment than as novel thinking or clearheadedness. As users peak, they may experience greater bodily awareness alongside feelings of heavy relaxation. Because this strain does less to promote activity and mobility, it can be beneficial to make sure your surroundings are soothing and familiar before consuming.\n\nAfghani is a convenient indoor grow, with its short, bushy stalks ranging between 2 and 4 feet high. Plants can produce a rapid high yield - flowering typically begins around week 8, with a full harvest possible at the 4 month mark. Although the strain is endemic to a mountainous Central Asian climate, it can be grown outdoors along similar latitudes. Look for dense, conical colas as the plants mature. \n\nAfghani is a classic for a reason - its heavy resin output has made it a traditional choice for the manufacture of hash. You don’t need a processed concentrate to appreciate the effects though. Enjoy Afghani for its blissful sedative properties and bask in its legacy as one of the seminal strains of modern cannabis culture.\n\n"

        "description": "The Emerald Triangle is perhaps the most famous triangle on earth for cannabis enthusiasts, however Triangle Kush may be a close second. This indica strain from Florida is named as a tribute to Tampa, Jacksonville and Miami – the 3 giants of cannabis production in the state, and potentially the South in general.\n\nWith a average THC levels a little over 20% and low CBD content, it is believed that the Triangle Kush was derived from the OG Kush of Florida, which in turn is linked to Hindu Kush, Lemon Thai and Chemdawg. \n\nThe plant and its buds have a very pungent and diesel-like aroma. Upon deeper inhales, a skunk undertone is also apparent, perhaps due to its strong OG Kush heritage.\n\nWhen smoking Triangle Kush buds expect heavy flavors to hit you immediately with your first inhale. The spicy taste is evident but the sour aftertaste of lemony flavors is what the strain is known for. This sourness is quite heavy and comes with hints of pine and earthy flavor, making for an interesting taste. \n\nThis strain’s effects are gradual, but ultimately build up to something beautiful. Triangle Kush makes you feel relaxed, and induces bouts of creativity, and is ideal for various types of artists. Users often engage in deep conversations after consuming this strain, because it creates a drive for discussion, and can make you more focused. Euphoria kicks in soon and has a lasting effect. However, it might make you a little dizzy.\n\nThe Triangle Kush also has some potent medical qualities. Since it makes you completely relaxed, it is good for those under stress. It helps you get rid of your anxiety. And it is perfect to relieve you of bodily pains, especially back pain and headaches. \n\nHailing from Florida, the Triangle Kush usually flower at approximately 70 days. It has low yield both indoors and outdoors, but it can become quite tall during the initial 21 days of flowering. It is grown best in dry climates, with a high CO2 content and warm environment of up to 88 degrees. Optimum soil pH for growing the Triangle Kush is between 5.8 and 6.0.\n\n"

        "description": "Tahoe Alien is another Indica-dominant, top shelf strain with plenty of medicinal benefits. The strain is a cross of Tahoe OG and Alien Kush, and has both a higher than average THC content and CBD content of roughly 21 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Although it hasn’t won any awards to date, it has still managed to raise the bar in terms of quality standards.\n\nTahoe Alien plants grow to a medium height. Its buds are of a conical shape and are of a light, minty green color with amber undertones and fiery orange hairs. The buds are large and stocky (they can be as much as three times the size of original Tahoe OG buds), and are extremely sticky due to the presence of a frosty layer of chunky, golden trichomes.\n\nThis strain emits an exquisite earthy, piney aroma with hints of citrus, which makes it a perfect companion for a group smoke session. Not only does it smell like a mix of its parents, Tahoe OG and Alien Kush, but there are hints of the Las Vegas Purple Kush in its scent as well.\n\nThe smell is reflected in the taste simultaneously – it gives users an earthy and piney flavor, mixed with hints of lemon and grape, upon use. There is also a luscious, earthy kush with piquant lemon pine aftertaste upon exhale.\n\nAs its name suggests, this strain is somehow connected to outer space – it will take users for a trip among the stars with a drifting, cerebral high combined with a pleasant and numbing body buzz, which creates a surreal feeling. Even though the Tahoe Alien is a super heavy strain, it is not excessively sedative or narcotic, which makes it perfect for evening or even afternoon use. The head rush it induces gives users a wonderful feeling of delight, and follows that up with boosts in creativity and appetite as well as helping in relaxation and sleep. This makes it perfect for recreational use.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned traits, Tahoe Alien also has numerous medicinal benefits. It helps to ease insomnia and nausea, while also alleviating stress, pain, muscle spasms and inflammations.\n\nThis strain was first grown by Alien Genetics. Its buds can mature as early as 8 weeks – although 9 weeks is recommended to ensure maximum density and potency. It is perfect for indoor cultivation, but can also grow smoothly outdoors in temperate climates. One thing to keep in mind when growing is that nutrients should be added carefully, as the Tahoe Alien can suffer from nutrient burn. However, growing it properly can reap large rewards, as it has a large yield.\n\n"

Born as a cross between Las Vegas Purple Kush (LVPK) and Alien Dawg, this strain is a mostly Indica hybrid with medium THC content of about 14%. \n\nThe Alien Kush plant is light green in color, with the sticky buds covered in red and orange hairs and shiny trichomes. The plant grows to a medium height, and is hardy, which makes it easy to grow both indoors and out. \n\nAlien Kush gives off an aroma which is piney, herbal, earthy and spicy at the same time. The scent is not only exotic, but also carries a hint of flowery sweetness as well as a citrusy taste. \n\nWhen it comes to taste, Alien Kush carries on the characteristics of its scent. Its strong and piquant taste is reminiscent of tea, with an earthy and woody undertone which is suggestive of post-rain damp soil.\n\nUnlike other strains, the Alien Kush contains numerous effects and benefits which make it impeccable for medicinal and recreational use. One hit from this strain initially hits the brain with trippy feelings that are more commonly experienced from Sativa strains. The buzz gradually settles in the body and promotes feelings of relaxation. \n\nThe high lasts for around 2 hours, during which time it promotes feelings of happiness, relaxation and elation. Moreover, Alien Kush frees the mind from lockdown and encourages creativity, which makes it perfect for recreational use. In addition, its ability to relax helps to soothe pain, headaches and nausea as well as increasing appetite and uplifting mood (and consequently fight depression). This makes it suitable for medicinal use as well.\n\nAlien Kush was first grown by The Cali Connection. It grows well in both hydro and soil, and the growth is complemented by trimming and the addition of organic nutrients. Although this strain has average yields (around 300g per square meter) it is hardy and easy to grow. Its flowering time is 8-9 weeks and it is ready for harvest in early to mid-October.\n\n"

This indica dominant hybrid has a high THC count and low CBD and never fails to delight both the recreational and medical user.\n\nSnow White, staying true to its name, is a pretty sight to behold. It grows to a maximum height of 36 inches (3 feet), and has a nice, closely packed and elegant bonsai spruce shape. Its leaves are oval, broad and dark green. The huge and dense buds are pleasantly soft. Even though they are dark green like the leaves, being thoroughly covered in an astounding number of resins makes the buds appear pale. Numerous dark brown and red hairs give the nugs an extra fluffy look, and the resins give the impression that the plant has recently been snowed upon, which makes it truly gorgeous.\n\nThis strain has an earthy, citrus laden aroma, which can also be found in its taste. The adventurous earthy flavor is complemented by a nutty and flowery sweetness, with a sweet lemon aftertaste. The smoke itself is very smooth and thick, and carry a citrusy flavor.\n\nSnow White, like the fairytale itself, is both very fun and helpful. It creates a pleasant and soothing body buzz and provides a mellow head high. It induces relaxing feelings of elation, happiness, hunger and creativity, which makes it perfect for recreational use. The high lasts for about 2 hours, and leaves a friendly, tingling sensation.\n\nIn addition to aiding in recreational activities, Snow White does wonders in terms of medicinal benefits as well. It helps to sooth effects of chemotherapy, nausea, and anxiety, while simultaneously alleviating depression, stress, pain, lack of appetite, insomnia and fatigue.\n\nFirst bred by Nirvana Seeds, this strain has quickly become a fan favorite. Flowering takes 8-10 weeks, but the early and abundant resin production starts just two weeks into flowering. Growers are recommended to use the Sea of Green hydro system for an exceptional yield – it commonly yields 450g per square meter in a Sea of Green under a 600W lamp. Although indoor cultivation is recommended, it can grow outside as well provided that there is the warmth and sunshine of a Mediterranean climate. Harvest is in October, and the high yield and delightful taste and effects has seen users rate this strain as ‘Exceptional and Outstanding’.\n\n"

There’s a dusting of trichomes that makes this a particularly difficult strain to break up by hand. The smell of berries hits you right away, with a pungent sour undertone and breaking up or grinding these nugs gives off the spiciness of its Haze lineage. The inhale is very smooth and has a nice sweet, creamy finish. \n\nDespite its intimidating name, White Nightmare gives a blissful sativa high.

It can also have medical benefits in the treatment of attention deficit disorders. \n\nWhite Nightmare can be cultivated indoors or outdoors. Grower report that the mature plant has a more stacked calyx with much fewer leaves than either of its parents. Although White Nightmare’s sativa genotype means typically tall plants, staked supports can help the tall, heavy calyxes from collapsing. Indoor flowering can happen within 60 to 70 days and outdoor harvest is ready in mid-October.\n\nA great recreational daytime choice, this strain lends itself well to solo enjoyment despite being a powerful sativa.

A good option for nighttime or for a lazy afternoon, White Moonshine can have a mildly creative vibe that is well-balanced with its more sedative effects. Although THC or CBD content is not high enough to provide significant medical benefits, White Moonshine can be helpful in the treatment of anxiety, as well as general aches and pains.\n\nLike most indica-dominant varieties, White Moonshine with its short, bushy plants can be conveniently grown indoors. Plants typically flower in about 10 weeks. In order to foster the growth of this strain’s trademark thick trichome coating, a low-humidity environment is recommended during the flowering period.\n\nWhite Moonshine has become popular for crossbreeding, used by Las Vegas-based Sin City Seeds in the production of several other resinous varieties. In all, this is a tasty, well-balanced strain that encourages relaxation without being incapacitating.\n\n"

        "description": "Many strains have exotic names, while others have exquisite tastes. Then there are those whom possess both such as Hawaiian Haze.\n\nThis premium fan-favorite, Sativa dominant strain, staying literal to its name was born from a cross between Hawaiian and Haze genetics. It has a staggering THC content of 26%. It is rumored that it was first grown in the rich, volcanic soil of Hawaii, and that is the reason behind this strain being so delightful.\n\nHawaiian Haze plants grow tall. The bright green buds are narrow and cylindrical, and are light, airy, and dense with a good trichome covering. The long and curly orange hairs, combined with the elegant and thin leaves, make the plant a sight to behold.\n\nIn terms of smell, the Hawaiian Haze is exactly what the name suggests. The blast of tropical flowery and fruity scent that hits users are nothing short of joyful, and this extravagance is carried on to the taste. \n\nThe taste of this strain is a wonderful combination of tropical flowers, like lavenders, and fruits such as pineapples and peaches. This exotic combination of smell and taste is what makes the Hawaiian Haze a true A-lister.\n\nNot only does the Hawaiian Haze have a fine taste, but it also has a lot of traits which make it suitable for recreational use. For instance, it induces a highly enjoyable and trippy head buzz which takes users for a joyride through the clouds. It also makes users feel happy, energetic, relaxed, and elated and uplifts mood. Many users have also reported to feeling more social and talkative thanks to this strain, which makes it perfect for daytime use.\n\nIt does equally well in the medicinal benefits department. Hawaiian Haze helps to alleviate depression, stress, nausea, fatigue and lack of appetite. This adds yet another feather in its cap. \n\nBred by Abraxas Seeds, this strain has an average yield – roughly 250-350g per square meter in a Sea of Green system. It flowers slowly, taking as much as 14 weeks, and harvests in late November. The seed should be grown under a 12/12 regimen of light indoors, to obtain a satisfactory yield.\n\nHaving an average yield and long flowering period points to two scenarios: Firstly, only experienced and patient growers should take up on growing it. Secondly, it is better suited for a specialist grower rather than a commercial one. Most users rate this strain as ‘Exceptional and Outstanding’, and quite rightly so – some of its feats are unparalleled.\n\n"

        "description": "The Hawaiian strain is a classic Sativa-dominant, hybrid strain of cannabis originating from the island of Hawaii. It is now grown in various places around the US, Canada and Holland and is a fundamental building block to a number of well known Sativa strains. Hawaiian’s THC level can be anywhere between 15% and 25%, and its CBD is listed at around 1%. \n\nAlthough its own lineage is unclear, the Hawaiian’s genes have been crossed with various strains to create Sativa-dominant hybrids that are rich in THC, such as Hawaiian Dream and Hawaiian Haze. \n\nHawaiian has large and dense buds with an abundance of orange hairs covering it. Under that layer of orange, the leaves are light green but don’t look very much appealing. It has a sweet but light aroma, with some citrus notes that my not always be evident. Smell-wise, Hawaiian is not so potent. \n\nThe taste is same as the smell – very sweet. Although the taste is not extraordinary, the tropical freshness and citrus-y taste complements the sweetness. The best thing is that the smoke doesn't irritate the lungs or throat, so it won’t make you cough. \n\nThe high you get from Hawaiian is mostly cerebral and it makes you feel incredibly happy. You can expect to feel uplifted and euphoric after a tiring day by smoking Hawaiian. However, the high keeps your head clear thus giving you the ability to focus on the task at hand, and be creative too. The effects on the body are not much.\n\nThe primary medical benefit of smoking Hawaiian is for stress relief. After a particularly long and stressful day, a few hits of Hawaiian can leave you feeling upbeat and revitalized. If you suffer from depression or have anxiety related issues, this strain could be helpful to you. Chronic pain and spasms can be treated with it too. However, be advised that the Hawaiian can make your mouth quite dry and make you thirsty after smoking it. \n\nThe light smell and the sweet tropical taste combined with the happy but clear buzz is what makes the Hawaiian such an outstanding strain of cannabis. Smoke it when you’re under stress and let it do its magic on you and make you feel significantly better.\n\n"

        "description": "West Coast Diesel is one the more recent California-grown Sativa hybrids that packs a punch. Its parentage is unclear, although it may have roots in Skunk #1 or its various crosses. Sometimes referred to as Kerosene Kush, this is an especially pungent variety that’s also notable for its 22-26% THC content.\n\nWest Coast Diesel buds are typically dark green, with threaded hairs that lean more brown than orange. Mature buds have a hardness and a density that become more prominent when cured. Trichome production is high, with sticky crystals coating the surface. The trademark gasoline smell of this strain takes center stage, with some sharp, lingering chemical notes. Not a subtle or nuanced hybrid by any means, West Coast Diesel also has a powerfully skunky diesel taste and acrid smoke that hits the back of your palate. \n\nThis strain is thought to have primarily sativa genetics and as such, its effects are stimulating and cerebral. With its high THC content, West Coast Diesel will have you buzzing before you’ve finished coughing. An energetic, uplifting high comes on quickly with little to no body-stone. Increased focus and clarity may help in the treatment of attention deficit disorders. Newcomers should be wary off the potential for paranoia, as the potent high can turn into introspective anxiety. West Coast Diesel is recommended for recreational daytime use. \n\nLike most sativas, West Coast Diesel can grow very tall and thrive outdoors under the right conditions. Because of its height, indoor growing can be a challenge. Indoor growers may also want to invest in odor control because of the strain’s extremely skunky smell. The plant has a heavy yield of colas - so whether growing inside or outside, bamboo poles or other sturdy supports can stop overburdened branches from breaking or sagging. Flowering can take 65 to 75 days in an indoor environment and up to 15 weeks outdoors.\n\nWest Coast Diesel is a great example of what can happen when breeders focus on enhancing a set of similar characteristics, rather than crossing varieties for new combinations. In this case, the valuable result is a concentrated diesel flavor and a sativa high that packs a punch.\n\n"

        "description": "Twilight is a pure Indica adapted from an original Afghani landrace strain. Amsterdam seed bank Dutch Passion cultivated Afghani plants from seed in the 1980s, breeding them to withstand a European climate - Twilight was the potent result. Although THC content is only a moderate 17%, this strain has the long-lasting Indica body stone typical of its lineage.\n\nTwilight buds are large, chunky, and hairy with neon green leaves. The original Afghani parent strain had some purple hues - accordingly, some buds of Twilight can have leaves that range from red to purple depending on the inclination of individual genotypes to produce anthocyanin pigment. The scent is primarily smooth and citrusy, with a diesel undertone that doesn’t overpower as it will in other strains. Lemon flavors intensify on smoking, with a faint chemical, diesel-like aftertaste on exhale. \n\nThe high from this strain creeps up slowly, with a tangible body high you might not detect until you try and stand. Couchlock can be common, and may intensify with continued consumption. These thorough sedative effects are matched by an easy, mellow euphoria. Disorientation or confusion are not as commonly reported - the mental uplift prevents heavy bodily effects from becoming incapacitating, making this a good strain for evening use, or, for a more experienced consumer, relaxed daytime use. Twilight can be a gentle option for mild insomnia, as well as general stress and chronic pain.\n\nBecause of its stable landrace genetics, Twilight can be more resistant to environmental stress. As a result, unlike many other indicas, it can thrive when grown outdoors. Plants average between 3 and 5 feet in height and have a high yield and very high resin production. Flowering happens outdoors in late September or Early October and indoors between 50 and 60 days.\n\nUnusual in its genetic integrity, Twilight brings the allure of a potent and physically resilient landrace to the modern market. Successfully harvested both commercially and by home growers, it can be enjoyed on its own merits or crossbred to create stable, potent new varieties.\n\n"

Amsterdam-based seed bank Devil’s Harvest Seed Company claims responsibility for its creation by crossing an original Afghani landrace strain with hybrids Cheese and San Fernando Valley OG. The result is a potent 20-22% THC sedative with a complex flavor profile.\n\nKhufu’s buds tend to form in smaller, clustered nugs. There is a prominent sharp tang from its Cheese parent strain along with the herbal, piney scent typical of Kush. Users of Khufu describe a clean, smooth inhale with a slight earthy taste.\n\nKhufu imparts the deep indica sedation of Afghani: a body high comes on quickly and induces lazy, couchlocked relaxation. Although there is a detectable cerebral uplift, it feels more stoney and psychedelic than sharp and productive. The near-narcotic properties make Khufu, like Afghani, beneficial for both insomnia and chronic body pain. This strain also has medical (and perhaps recreational) benefits as an appetite stimulant - an increase in hunger is the most common reported effect. Khufu is best used at night, or in relaxing, undemanding daytime settings. \n\nBecause of its stable genetic diversity, Khufu is more resistant to adverse conditions than many other strains and can be grown successfully both indoors and outdoors. Plants are characteristically short and bushy with a flowering time of around 60 days. Khufu is prized for a low volume of leaves and a very heavy yield. Calyxes are dense and taper off into tight, distinct pyramidal structures. \n\nJust as true of cannabis as it is of human genetics, variation can ensure health and stability in a population. Khufu’s large accumulation of genotypes from different parent strains makes it an attractive prospect for child strains of its own.\n\n"

Happy Kush’s THC content is as yet undocumented. \n\nBuds of Happy Kush are dense and very resinous. They appear covered in trichomes and are medium to dark green. Buds and plants have occasional undertones of blue and purple, although these qualities may be more due to circumstantial exposure to cold weather or low pH during the growing process in individual crops than to a consistent, intentional phenotype in the strain. Happy Kush smells intensely herbal with strong pine and lemon notes. \n\nHappy Kush has a heavy full-body stone with great benefits for insomnia and relaxation, and enough of a Sativa high to impart a pleasant head buzz. A good recreational option for those with stress and anxiety, Happy Kush might also be useful in the treatment of PTSD (its parent strain Happy Brother was named a Top 5 Strain for Veterans by High Times). Some users also report stimulation of appetite. With more of a nighttime vibe, Happy Kush is often associated with sleepiness and couchlock. \n\nBecause of its shorter, indica-dominant plants, Happy Kush is a solid indoor grow, with flowering happening around 65 to 75 days. Yield can be average, with thick calyxes but a high volume of leaves.\n\nValuable for its deep properties of relaxation and its bright and long-lasting flavor, Happy Kush has been crossbred to create Sin City Seeds’ Happy Nightmare.\n\n"

        "description": "Blue Moonshine is an almost entirely Indica hybrid and has the unique distinction of being bred entirely from landrace strains. With roots in Afghani as well as Thai and Mexican landraces, Blue Moonshine has some surprising botanical and psychoactive properties that it’s inherited from these far-flung endemic strains. Though it’s considered a powerful sedative indica, Blue Moonshine’s THC content has been measured at only around 13%. \n\nBlue Moonshine buds are dense and can be very hard when cured. As with the strain’s original Afghani ancestor, trichomes are plentiful and the buds have a caked, resinous texture. Notes of blueberry and molasses are prominent, with a spicy scent coming through after grinding or breaking apart. Blue Moonshine has the thick, harsh smoke prized by lovers of Hash varieties, and inhaling can be harsh and cough-inducing. On the exhale, some users report the fermented taste of sour mash - a possible inspiration for the “Moonshine” in this strain’s name.\n\nBlue Moonshine has an intense narcotic high with tranquilizing effects that permeate both body and mind. The initial effects can be heady, marked by giddiness and distraction. Gradually, a strong sense of calm spreads throughout the body and couchlock is common. The heavy sedative properties can sometimes induce the sensation of numbness or of disconnection from the body. This sense of deep relaxation can be accompanied by increased awareness - creativity in particular may be stimulated. Blue Moonshine’s high is described as lasting longer than average, making it an attractive option for nighttime use. Medically, this strain’s general potency on both body and mind can have benefits for insomnia, chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and appetite stimulation.\n\nBlue Moonshine’s pure indica heritage means that plants are shorter – growers report plants reaching between three to five feet – and easily grown indoors. Plants will flower between 50 and 60 days. By harvest, there is a moderate to high yield of buds, and a high leaf-to-calyx ratio. \n\nBlue Moonshine is a great example of diversified genetics yielding a desirable new variety. Overall, this strain a uniquely sensory experience, from the complex smell and flavor of its buds to the well-rounded, persistent high.\n\n"

        "description": "Black Cherry Soda is an eye-catching hybrid strain with the dense bud structure characteristic of Indica, but a mobile, cerebral high more typical of Sativa. As its name implies, Black Cherry Soda is prized for a unique taste but is also notable for its vivid color. While its exact parentage is unknown, this strain’s potency is obvious: THC content ranges from 19 to 30%.\n\nBuds of Black Cherry Soda are immediately distinguished by their color, which can vary from green with distinct traces of light purple to a vivid, uniform dark purple without any hint of green. Buds also have noticeably fewer orange hairs. This hybrid’s Indica genetics are evident in its sticky, trichome-laden texture and its tightly packed flowers. The dried buds should smell fruity with notes of berry and some earthiness. Flavor is key - this strain really does taste like a black cherry soda, with a surprisingly creamy aftertaste observed on second or third hits.\n\nWith its energizing and sharp cerebral effects, Black Cherry Soda is well-suited to daytime productivity. Recreational users report sustained creativity and enthusiasm, and a general sense of euphoria. The initially cerebral, head-buzzing effects are complemented by a mild body high. Although Black Cherry Soda is low in CBD, its positive medical attributes include stress relief and stimulation of appetite. \n\nCultivators of Black Cherry Soda will find success growing the strain both indoors and outdoors. Plants average about five to six feet tall and begin to flower after eight weeks. The strain produces a solid yield with large, chunky colas and a good leaf to bud ratio. \n\nSome grow notes on this strain’s purple hues: Cannabis flowers turn purple due to the presence of anthocyanins, pigment molecules in the plant’s cells that lurk just beneath the more well-known pigment chlorophyll. In the same way that foliage changes color in colder autumn weather, the anthocyanins in cannabis buds become more stimulated (and produce more purple) if the plant is exposed to a cooler environment in the flowering stage. Black Cherry Soda has been bred to contain a high volume of active anthocyanins, so depending on the phenotype of your seeds, you’ll see varying degrees of saturated purple in the mature buds.\n\nAlthough some traditionalists see this strain’s standout color as nothing more than gimmicky\n“bag appeal,” its special flavor profile is undeniable. Black Cherry Soda’s unique smell and taste are best appreciated in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe.\n\n"

Despite this genetic puzzle, users enjoy Big Skunk Korean for its unique taste and Sativa-leaning properties.\n\nBuds of Big Skunk Korean are typically large and resinous like those of its possible parent Big Bud. Leaves can contain some purple pigment, a trait also evident in child strain Lavender. Users report a primarily floral, herbal aroma in the intact buds, with some pungent hash and skunk observed after grinding.\n\nA strong head high is the primary effect, which gradually moves towards disorientation and confusion. A subtle body high is also noticeable, although not potent enough for immobilization. Encouraging relaxation and talkativeness, this is a good strain for social and daytime use.\n\nAn emerging strain with potential for greater cultivation, growers describe Big Skunk Korean faring well indoors. Yield can be above average, although flowering can take as long as 15 weeks.\n\nThis strain has been valuable in crossbreeding, having parented the popular herbal Lavender as well as the citrus-heavy Kilimanjaro. It remains to be seen whether the supposed Korean landrace lineage of this strain lends it any particular potency. Cannabis is strictly prohibited in South Korea and although it’s -- shockingly -- openly tolerated in North Korea, the latter country’s current political climate means that we may not have insight into viable Korean landrace strains for some time.\n\n"

        "description": "Jamaican Strain, or simply Jamaican, refers to the varieties of Sativa endemic to the island of Jamaica. Although these strains are generally considered to fit the definition of a landrace, cannabis did not actually exist in Jamaica until brought over by Indian indentured servants in the 1840s and 1850s when the British Empire ruled both Jamaica and India -- in fact, the word ganja, often used in Jamaica to refer to cannabis, is a variation of the Bengali word for hemp. The plant took quickly to Jamaica’s tropical climate and has since become renowned for its potent cerebral effects. Often sought out by tourists in Jamaica, true Jamaican Strain can be difficult to come by elsewhere. \n\nThe Jamaican cannabis plant may be almost unrecognizable to consumers of more commercially packaged bud. Once cured, leaves from the plant’s long branches can appear sparse - they are thin and wispy and do not have the “shrunken” and compact appearance of indica and sativa hybrid buds. Leaves are forest green to dark green, with hairs that appear more brown than orange. Jamaican is famously pungent, with an almost eye-watering, skunky-sweet musk. The skunk scents are concentrated when this strain is burned. Users report inhaling a harsh, stinging smoke.\n\nA true sativa, Jamaican has pervasive cerebral qualities. The high has mellow, buzzing bodily effects but is mostly marked by stimulation of mental acuity. Euphoria and perceptions of clearer thinking are common. Those lucky enough to have enjoyed Jamaican Strain claim that they experience talkativeness and an increased feeling of sociability. This is an energizing daytime strain and beneficial for deep creative thinking.\n\nIf you’re able to obtain Jamaican Strain seeds for cultivation, an outdoor growing environment is best, as plants can quickly outgrow the confines of an enclosed environment. Jamaican plants will also thrive in a tropical climate, so sharing an approximate latitude with Jamaica is a benefit. This strain is best for growers with patience, as flowering can take as long as 5 months.\n\nLike many landraces, Jamaican Strain is prized for its stability and potency, having yielded popular crossbred strains like Lambsbread and Marley’s Collie. However, in a market that prefers novelty crossbreeds, more traditional cannabis consumers and horticulturists consider the pure Jamaican landrace to be in danger of falling into obscurity. The 2015 High Times World Cannabis Cup was held in Negril, Jamaica, specifically to encourage the participation of local breeders and to document and preserve pure Jamaican Strains.\n\n"

They range in color from faintly to entirely dark purple, as different phenotypes of the strain can have varying tendencies to produce the pigment anthocyanin; bright orange hairs contrast with the purple-green hues, giving this strain particular bag appeal. A sweet berry scent is most evident in the flowers, but gives way to sugary grape notes – almost reminiscent of grape-flavored fruit snacks – when ignited or vaporized. Purple princess has a smooth smoke when inhaled and some earthier notes of cinnamon or chocolate on exhale.\n\nThe high builds slowly - this strain is often referred to as a “creeper” - and may engender some initial confusion as you find yourself pinned down with deep feelings of contentment and relaxation. A great choice for evening use, Purple Princess is a gentle stress reliever. Although too low in CBD content to be considered medical-grade, it can nevertheless reduce general aches and pains. Its particular clear and creative mental high is an antidote to work-a-day monotony. \n\nPurple Princess can be grown indoors or outdoors. Because they flower relatively quickly at 5 to 7 weeks, plants can thrive even in a higher altitude with early frosts. This strain is known for a heavy yield with long, bunchy calyxes. \n\nAlthough not a knockout in terms of potency, Purple Princess delivers a well-balanced, mildly introspective effect that argues for quality of psychoactivity over quantity of THC. Its visual and palate appeal also make it a fun strain to show off or share with friends.\n\n"

        "description": "Ice Queen is a Sativa hybrid crossed from flavorful Cinderella 99 and the notorious 1995 Cannabis Cup winner and perennial favorite White Widow. With a high trichome county and a THC content between 18 and 23%, this strain is an energizing option for daytime use.\n\nIce Queen’s buds range in color from dark green to almost brown. The cured flowers have plentiful leaves with the airy, fluffy texture typical of purer Sativa. Mostly notably, buds have inherited the heavy resin output of their White Widow parent - a dusting of trichomes coats the exterior, making this strain sticky enough to merit use of a grinder. The predominant scent is sweetly herbal with some lavender. Broken open, the nugs smell more peppery, reminiscent of some hash strains. Inhaled, the smoke is especially smooth - spicy flavors are intensified on the exhale.\n\nAt first, the high from Ice Queen is entirely head-focused with a pressure around the eyes and temples. A strong cerebral focus takes hold, making this an ideal strain for those with difficulty finding motivation for creative or even mundane tasks. Creativity mingles with a general sense of euphoria. Users describe a more indica-like body melt as they come down from the peak - although you may not experience total couchlock, sleep may come more easily.\n\nResistant to temperature fluctuations, Ice Queen can be grown indoors or outdoors, although indoor growers should plan ahead for plants as tall as 6 feet. This strain forms thick, ample calyxes that are heavily branched and tend to be long and tapered. Indoor flowering time ranges between 7 to 8 weeks while outdoor harvest comes particularly late, in the end of October.\n\nFans of Ice Queen enjoy the strain for its no-hassle, well-balanced high. Mildly fragrant, it’s a relatively discreet choice for use outdoors - the perfect thing for a mellow afternoon in the park.\n\n"

        "description": "Oriental Express is a potent Sativa hybrid with some prestigious genetics. It is the product of Trainwreck - which itself is a cross of Mexican, Thai, and Afghani landraces - and a pure Thai landrace, created by breeder Billy Goat Seeds. These diverse and solid building blocks make for a strain with a complex flavor profile and nuanced effects. Oriental Express should not be confused with Orient Express, a Sativa hybrid from Ace Seeds that is also crossed from Asian landraces. \n\nFlowers of Oriental Express have a characteristic Sativa look, with spring green leaves in a loose, fluffy bud structure. The smell of the dried buds is similar to that of Trainwreck, a sweet and earthy combination of lemon and pine. The skunkiness of the Thai parent adds a pungent kick, making the overall scent more funky than herbal. When smoked, too, this strain has a pungent, cough-inducing taste more typical of an Indica. Notes of earth and dirt can be detected when exhaling.\n\nThe mostly cerebral high of this strain creeps on slowly. Users describe little sense of heaviness or body stone and instead experience an energizing head rush. Although similar to the clearheaded high of Thai, Oriental Express feels even more supercharged, with the potential for a disorienting sensation of “mindrace” - frantic, speedy thoughts that the user may not be able to control. Under the right circumstances though, the cerebral focus of this strain can be beneficial for attention deficit disorders. Oriental Express is a strain made for daytime use, with its powerful, mobilizing effects.\n\nAlthough Oriental Express has a long time to maturity - 9 to 10 weeks indoors and a late October harvest outdoors - the yield of buds can almost triple during flowering. As such, it is recommended that growers top off plants during the vegetative cycle so that as much light can reach the lower branches as possible.\n\nAlthough this strain’s name alludes only to its Asian ancestry (of which it has a double dose, with Thai landraces in both parental lines), Oriental Express is an amalgamation of many different commercially viable landraces. These stable and varied genetics make for a potent experience - they also make Oriental Express valuable as a parent strain for further crossbreeding.\n\n"

Its name conjures up its appealing herbal scent, but is also an acronym for Sativa/Afghani Genetic Equilibrium. Indeed, at 20-25% THC, S.A.G.E. strikes an equilibrium between the sedative properties of Indica and energizing Sativa effects. \n\nBuds of S.A.G.E. are very leafy, but fluffy and loose like pure Sativas. Trichomes are plentiful - in fact, hash made from S.A.G.E.’s copious resin won second place in the 1999 Cannabis Cup.  When cured, the large, sticky flowers are an earthy green to brown. The deep sage scent, typical of Haze, makes for a woody taste with a hint of fruit. This nuanced flavor profile won S.A.G.E. 2nd prize in a 2001 Cannabis Cup blind taste test. This strain burns smoothly and has a sweet sensation on exhale.\n\nWith equal parts cerebral buzz and body stone, S.A.G.E. comes on quickly. Users describe a mostly tranquil, lightheaded high that persists longer than average. Although the narcotic calm of parent Afghani is present, it is tempered by a particular mental clarity. These potent, well-rounded effects can lend themselves to either motivation for daytime tasks or to focused relaxation. This strain can be particularly creative, clearing the mundane distractions that typically cloud perception. Aside from its mentally grounding properties, S.A.G.E. can also be beneficial for insomnia and chronic pain relief. \n\nBecause of its stable, mostly landrace lineage, S.A.G.E. is particularly resistant to fluctuations in environmental temperature and can be grown indoors or outdoors. Growers describe plants as 4 to 5 feet high, with a long flowering time - 9 to 10 weeks indoors and ready for harvest in late September. Although a slow grower, this strain has large yields and calyxes can double during flowering time. Topping off the taller fan leaves before flowering can help light reach these lower flowers.\n\nS.A.G.E. is a rare strain that pulls off the balancing act between couchlock and a racing mind. A mix of landrace genetics from almost every global region where cannabis grows indigenously, its quality is obvious in its rich flavor and stable high.\n\n"

It is descended from the legendary Chemdawg strain which is thought to be crossed from Thai and Nepalese landraces by U.S. East Coast breeders. The phenotypes of Chemdawg 91 can waver between indica-dominant and sativa-dominant, but its THC content is strong and has been measured at levels as high as 24%.\n\nChemdawg 91 buds are average-sized and very sticky. Trichomes coat the brownish-green flowers, making them difficult to break without a grinder. The strain has a dank, earthy smell which, when buds are broken apart, turns more harsh and skunky (leading some to propose parentage from a Skunk strain). When burned, Chemdawg 91 has a particularly diesel, chemical flavor. The smoke is smooth, and flavors of citrus can be detected when exhaled.  For you terpene brainiacs, Chemdawg is high in pinene. \n\nThe strain has an initially bracing head high, with pressure behind the temples that can lead to dry, red eyes. Users report a sense of euphoria and progressively cerebral thinking. This altered thinking can include the sensation of time dilation. The uplifting mental effects are matched by a subtle body high that lingers after comedown. Chemdawg 91 is especially beneficial for stress relief and may be best suited to early evening use.\n\nWhether cultivated indoors or outdoors, this strain has a pungency that makes discretion difficult. With a flowering time of 9 -10 weeks indoors and an outdoor harvest as late as early November, Chemdawg 91 is not a quick grow. Plants have an average to high yield. \n\nChemdawg 91 is in good company; its Chemdawg parent strain has spawned popular staple varieties like Sour Diesel and OG Kush. Bold and balanced, this is a potent strain for recreational use.\n\n"

Generally uplifting effects along with a 15 to 20% THC content make this a solid all-purpose strain.\n\nCritical Plus buds are olive to dark green and form in long teardrop shapes. Purple hues with red-orange pistils in some phenotypes give this strain serious bag appeal. The nugs are extremely sticky and dense, best broken up with a grinder. The scent of lemon zest comes through first, accented by some sour pungency from the Skunk parent. When combusted, the flowers have a greater earthiness. On exhale, users describe a chemical tang like the taste of lemon-scented cleaner.\n\nThe high from Critical Plus starts in the head, imparting a quickly altered state. Users describe a surge in creativity and talkativeness, suited to social use. As the high progresses, mild bodily effects from Big Bud kick in. This strain can also be used alone, as its body buzz contributes to relief from stress and chronic pain. Critical Plus’ combination of euphoria and relaxation lend themselves to afternoon or evening enjoyment.\n\nCritical Plus has Indica-like plants that are bushy and easily grown indoors. Flowering happens after six to seven weeks indoors and outdoor plants are ready for outdoor harvest in early October. Although somewhat susceptible to mold, this strain has a very high yield that may balance out any loss of flowers. Because Critical Plus’ skunkiness is so strong, growers are advised to invest in odor control measures like carbon filters.\n\nCritical Plus caught on quickly in its native Spain, having won the first Highlife Cup in Barcelona. This strain is gaining popularity in U.S. markets for its balance and versatility.\n\n"

A substantial coating of trichomes gives leaves a silvery-white appearance. Buds have a bit of earthiness when ground and burned. Smoke is very smooth and tastes of dank pine when exhaled. \n\nThe White’s high arrives quickly in the form of bracing cerebral energy. Even with small doses, users describe a capacity for intense focus, making this a valuable strain for treatment of ADD or ADHD. Energizing and with almost no feelings of body stone, The White is a particularly thoughtful strain, useful for general contemplation or specific problem-solving tasks. Because of The White’s potency, novice users are advised to moderate initial intake so as to avoid the potential paranoia or anxiety that can come with such a strong Sativa.\n\nThe White is a clone-only strain, meaning that in order to achieve the characteristic plant structure and cerebral high, it can only be grown via clippings from a mature plant of the same variety. Although a Sativa, it can be grown indoors and will begin flowering within six to seven weeks. Growers should trim any undergrowth of broad fan leaves to allow buds on the lower part of the plant to flourish. Growers may also want to allow The White’s trademark trichomes to fully coat the flowers before harvesting.\n\nA powerhouse Sativa, The White is a prime choice for daytime use in creative settings or mindsets. Because of its mild scent and taste, it can also be used in cannabis butter or other infusions to add psychoactivity without any pungent flavor.\n\n"

It grows tall and bushy, and produces stems which are packed with alternating floral clusters. The plants can grow as high as 4 feet indoors, and around 6 feet outdoors. In fact, during flowering time, many growers compare Nepal OG’s impressive growth to that of Bruce Banner turning into the Hulk. \n\nIts buds are medium sized and compact, and are bright green in color. The beautiful buds are so thickly coated in resins that it almost seems as if a second layer of resins is growing atop the existing ones. Nepal OG has an interesting combination of fruity, spicy, sour, earthy and piney flavors.\n\nThis strain is extremely fast acting. It hits hard and immediately creates the indica trademark effect – a soaring body buzz, which is followed by a serious couch lock. Even highly experienced users get the desired effects quickly after smoking this powerful strain. Nepali OG induces feelings of creativity, euphoria and calmness in addition to helping with a lack of appetite and alleviating pain. All these properties makes it perfect for recreational as well as medicinal use.\n\nNepali OG was first bred by Flying Dutchmen. It has a flowering period of approx. 60 days, and serves up a medium yield. It grows well indoors, outdoors, and also in greenhouses. The plant prefers the Screen of Green (SCROG) setup, and grows well in soil as well, but not so much in hydro. \n\nNepali OG’s strong nature makes it perfect for evening and nighttime use, especially if looking to let your muscles get some rest after a tiring day.\n\n"

A pungent, skunky and diesel undertone follows on consequent inhales. \n\nArcata Trainwreck takes some time to settle down and hit the user - the first hit is felt after roughly 5 minutes. Due to this gradual high, many first timers consume more than necessary, so do wait for the effect to hit you instead of rushing. It induces feelings of elation and happiness, and uplifts mood. It also boosts creativity and helps the user to relax.\n\nThis wonderful strain is recommended to those suffering from insomnia, stress and fatigue, and its mood lifting potential helps massively against depression as well. Arcata Trainwreck is particularly effective against pain, migraine and nausea.\n\nFirst grown in the Humboldt County in California in the early 1980s, this cannabis strain is nowadays grown by Jaws Gear. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor growth, and its creeping growing style makes it especially suitable for ScroG. Arcata Trainwreck has a flowering period of roughly 8-10 weeks.

Users describe a euphoria that comes on quickly and lasts longer than average. Physical effects tend to manifest more as an increase in energy that can border on a jumpy caffeine buzz for some. The clearheaded and motivating high from this strain is well-suited to daytime productivity.

It has sticky, dense and pungent flowers with tight, resin coated buds which are extremely sticky and almost white. Its scent is a bit strange – it resembles burnt plastic mixed with lemon and diesel. However, there is nothing strange about its taste – a long lasting piney, earthy sweet with a hint of mustiness. The smoke of this strain is very smooth.\n\nThis powerful strain is considered to be one of the most powerful Indicas in the world. Its hypnotic cerebral effects hit almost immediately. Smoking this strain causes the eyelids to become very heavy and droop, thus making MK Ultra perfect for patients suffering from insomnia. It induces a heavy couch lock, which makes it suitable to combat stress as well.\n\nUpon use, users often demonstrate signs of giddiness, with an ever-present smile on their faces. Thus, depression can also be cured with the help of this exceptional strain.\n\nMK Ultra was originally grown by T.H. Seeds. Its short stature makes it suitable for indoor growth, but it can be grown outdoors as well. It takes 8-9 weeks to flower, and has an above average yield of 350gm per square meter.\n\nMK Ultra is a highly effective medical marijuana strain, and all of its relaxing properties makes it perfect for evening and nighttime use.\n\n"

        "description": "Blue God is an Indica hybrid with strong narcotic effects. The child of God Bud and Blueberry, both Cannabis Cup winners, it has a heavy onset but only a moderate THC composition at 15 to 20%.\n\nBlue God’s buds are dense, with leaves that appear more violet than green. Resin production is high - a blanket of trichomes makes the dried flowers appear almost iridescent. Famously potent parent strain Blueberry comes through strong on the palate. When broken up, buds give off a more dank, earthy odor. Smoke is harsh and expands quickly, inducing coughing, although it does not have the hashy acrid tang of similarly heavy Indicas. When inhaled, this strain has a rich berry flavor, similar to a blue raspberry slushie.\n\nBlue God has a high that takes root entirely in the body. A nighttime strain for sure, it creeps up slowly, slowing down breathing and relaxing muscle tension. Any mental effects are more psychedelic than cerebral - music or movies can seem surreal and amplified. In general, the spacey, stoned feeling from Blue God precludes any sense of focus. The tranquilizing effects of this strain are effective for chronic pain, anxiety, and especially insomnia.\n\nWith a typical Indica stature, Blue God is easily grown indoors. Plants top out at three to four feet tall indoors and have wide lateral branches; outdoors, plants may grow as high as eight to twelve feet. Flowering happens within eight weeks indoors and plants are ready for outdoor harvest as late as early October.\n\nMore of a knockout strain than a motivator, Blue God packs a punch despite its characteristically low THC content. Hanging at home will feel more appealing than burning through a to-do list - in fact, it may be all that you’re able to do.\n\n"

        "description": "Blue Cookies is a slightly indica-leaning hybrid that offers a great balance of mental and physical effects. Established staple hybrids Girl Scout Cookies and Blueberry unite to yield this tasty flower with a focused and clearheaded but very relaxed high. Said to be a potent smoke even for cannabis veterans, Blue Cookies has a THC composition that ranges from 20% to an impressive 25%. Note that there is a different (albeit similar) strain called Blue Cookies on the market that is a distinct phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies itself rather than a cross between GSC and Blueberry.\n\nBlue Cookies’ buds are big and chunky with a dense structure more typical of indica varieties. The leaves clump together in slightly long, conical shapes that are threaded through with red to fiery orange pistils. Like parent strain Blueberry, Blue Cookies is marked by particularly colorful flowers: they appear spring green and more often than not are flecked with blue and purple hues. These latter colors emerge when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Cloudy trichomes cover the already-colorful leaves, giving them a silvery sheen. The high resin content also makes Blue Cookies a hard strain to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. Blue Cookies has bold flavors to match its visual appeal. Users will notice a simultaneously fruity and dank smell from the cured buds that feels like a combination of Blueberry’s berry and GSC’s earthy profiles. Breaking or burning the flowers brings out a rich smell that is more reminiscent of leather. The smoke hits very smoothly and carries a slight taste of cherry with some skunk on the exhale. Interestingly, despite its purple coloration, Blue Cookies does not have a detectable grape flavor -- this is because the same anthocyanin pigments that dictate the strain’s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.\n\nAs with many evenly-balanced hybrids, Blue Cookies takes hold first in the head, with a quick and possibly disorienting rush. This initial buzz soon spreads throughout the body just as smokers notice a change in perception of their surroundings. This merging of head and body high is stimulating but not overwhelming, keeping users grounded and able to bend the experience to fit their surroundings. Blue Cookies is as enjoyable out on a walk or a hike as it is for a night on the couch. This strain’s stimulation of both brain and both also makes it great for activities that involve both -- it can be a good exercise aid and even an aphrodisiac. Similarly, Blue Cookies has value as a medical treatment for both physical and psychological afflictions. Its sense of lucidity and focus can be great for patients with attention deficit disorders. It can also have powerful effects on depressed or anxious mood, providing anything from mellow contentment to euphoria. Somatic relaxation makes Blue Cookies a good analgesic treatment for aches, pains, and nausea. In high enough concentrations, this can help insomniacs find deep and restful sleep.\n\nDespite its potent and well-rounded high, authenticated seeds of Blue Cookies can be hard to come by. Prospective growers may need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow healthy clones. Once procured, Blue Cookies can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing calls for a moderate to warm climate with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 to 74 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoor growing conditions can be more deliberately controlled, and the short to medium-height plants can take well to limited spaces -- especially if growers do some limited bending and pruning early in the vegetative stage. Growers should also regularly trim away the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of plants in order to let light and air reach the lower flowering nodes. Bringing out this strain’s signature colors requires “shocking” the plant by exposing it to some colder than average temperatures just before flowering begins. Blue Cookies flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors, at which point growers may need to provide artificial supports like wooden dowels to keep the thick buds from weighing down branches. This strain offers an average yield of flowers.\n\nIf you can come by it, Blue Cookies offers a great taste and a crowd-pleasing, well-balanced high. Its potency makes it enjoyable for newbies and experienced cannabis users alike. As long as it’s consumed in moderation, this strain’s versatile make it appropriate for both daytime and nighttime enjoyment.\n\n"

        "description": "While it has a name that conjures up the sinister American defense contractor or the epic Game of Thrones battle, Blackwater is a heavy indica strain with a much more laid-back vibe. This variety is a cross between two celebrated California strains: the fruity Mendocino Purple from NorCal and L.A.’s own hashy San Fernando Valley (SFV) OG Kush. With very sticky flowers and a pleasant, floaty high, it’s no wonder this strain won 3rd Best Indica in the 2014 Cannabis Cup. Blackwater’s THC, as measured by cannabis lab Analytics 360, can range from 10% to a potent 20%.\n\nBlackwater’s chunky buds have a classically indica bud structure: leaves are densely-packed and tightly curled in on themselves when properly cured. High resin production makes the leaves adhere in large, solid flowers rather than popcorn-like nuggets. The flowers appear dark green, with some phenotypes showing flashes of purple inherited from the Mendocino Purple parent strain; this latter color comes about when high concentrations of specific pigments are activated by colder than average weather in the cultivation process. Blackwater’s large, colorful buds are covered in a substantial layer of trichomes, often making them difficult to break apart by hand. This strain’s “bag appeal” persists even after the bag is cracked open -- users will notice a deeply sweet smell of berry and grape to complement its purple hues. Taking time to break open the flowers will also show evidence of the Afghani landrace lineage, with an unmistakably herbal, hashy smell. When burnt, Blackwater gives off an incense-like smoke that is surprisingly smooth for an indica. The satisfying hit finishes with a fruity and vaguely skunky cloud that may linger for a while.\n\nDefinitely a strain made for staying in and not venturing out, Blackwater offers a palpable indica body stone. Although it mounts slowly, smokers shouldn’t underestimate this high’s ability to comfortably pin them down in their surroundings. Within minutes, a sense of calm envelops the core and spreads down through the limbs, allowing users to breathe comfortably and easily. Although there may be some psychedelic changes in perception like visual distortion, cerebral thinking isn’t common; users should expect a more dreamy high, perfect for unwinding with a movie or some favorite music without bothering to follow along or reflect too intensely. This full body high intensifies as greater amounts are consumed. Medically speaking, these narcotic effects have diverse applications. Blackwater’s physical numbing makes it an effective painkiller for those with aches and pains, whether incidental from exercise or injury, or more chronic caused by conditions like fibromyalgia. It can even relieve some of the negative side effects of chemotherapy treatment. Blackwater is also helpful for stress-related conditions like anxiety and PTSD, temporarily melting away preoccupations and concerns. In large enough doses, this strain can induce deep sleep for those who suffer from insomnia. With a high that lasts longer than average, Blackwater is known to be one potent indica, even for those with a high tolerance for THC.\n\nAlthough it may be more difficult to track down, Blackwater can be grown as a clone, from clippings of other plants, or from packaged retail seed. Cultivation can happen in or outdoors. Outdoor growing requires a consistently warm and semi-humid climate, with daytime temperatures around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers have more control over conditions indoors, and the short, bushy plants -- which are as classically indica as this strain’s buds -- take well to limited grow spaces. Growers are encouraged to “top” plants throughout the vegetative process, by trimming any broad, light-blocking fan leaves to allow light and air to reach the lower flowering branches. Blackwater flowers within 8 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers an average yield. Because of this strain’s prized taste and THC content, growers should also take care to properly cure their buds, first hanging them for a week in warm surroundings with 50% humidity and then jarring them (and regularly checking them for mold) in similarly warm conditions with 60-65% humidity.\n\nIncreasingly popular in recreational west coast markets, Blackwater is a great strain for kicking back in the evening -- or at least during a slow day without obligations. Its heavy body stone and great flavor are a treat whether you’re alone at the end of a workday or kicking back with some good friends. Blackwater’s high resin production can also be valuable when producing hash or other concentrates; its unique flavor can carry over into these concentrates as well. A true knockout, Blackwater can be a fun introduction to indicas, but newcomers should moderate intake pending their individual tolerance.\n\n"

        "description": "Bay Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid with an intoxicating smell to match its potent head high. This strain is the creation of Granddaddy Purple, a breeding collective based in Northern California who also claim responsibility for the eponymous Grandaddy Purple strain. Bay Dream is a cross between the wildly popular Blue Dream and Grandaddy Purple Collective’s own fruity sativa Bay 11. This is a tasty, energizing strain that’s perfect for waking and baking or socializing. Cannabis testing lab Analytics 360 has measured the THC composition of Bay Dream flowers at between a modest 12% and an impressive 26%.\n\nBay Dream is marked by its visually striking, medium-sized nuggets. The flowers have a relatively loose bud structure, typical of sativas, with soft and pliable leaves. The leaves themselves are predominantly light green, although some phenotypes of the strain may show traces of faint to dark purple. These purple hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics which trigger a color change when plants stimulated by cold temperatures. The colorful flowers are accented by pale yellow pistils, meant to catch pollen from male plants. Leaves are also frosted with trichomes which make the soft leaves very sticky to the touch. When cured properly, buds have a complex aroma that blends the unique scents of both parent strains -- Blue Dream imparts some fruity, berry-like tang and Bay 11 gives a little bit of pine. When this strain is combusted, smoke is smooth and has more of a citrus smell and taste that hits the front of the tongue.\n\nThis strain has a high that builds slowly for a sativa, starting with some changes in breathing and soon making itself known as a pressure around the temples. Users feel a more intense awareness of their surrounding and may feel more talkative. Depending on the individual user’s level of experience with cannabis and tendency towards anxiety, Bay Dream may be powerfully disorienting in this sense. The feeling of having a loud inner monologue, a common effect of many strong sativas, is often reported. In a positive and familiar environment, users can direct this high towards creative pursuits. It’s also a great strain for working on tasks that involve problem solving, as it encourages non-traditional and lateral thinking. In social contexts, Bay Dream facilitates conversation because of the way it induces free association. This strain’s cerebral properties makes it an effective treatment for some cognitive and mood disorders. Its feeling of immediacy can be a boon to patients suffering from depression or stress, helping them to be generally more present and mindful. Its sense of focus can also be good for those with attention deficit disorders. Bay Dream has relatively few pain-relieving effects, but it has some physical usefulness in its ability to increase energy, motivating some people to exercise. It can also be a strong appetite stimulant. As mentioned, because it encourages rapid-fire and recursive thinking, this may not be the best option for those prone to anxiety. Bay Dream is also not an ideal nighttime smoke, as it may leave users feeling wired and alert.\n\nA rare strain to come by, Bay Dream is only available as a clone from fellow growers; breeders Grandaddy Purple Collective have not directly packaged and released seeds its seeds for sale. Bay Dream can be can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires warm and humid Mediterranean-like temperatures with daytime temperatures in the 70-80 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoor, plants can be easily managed, as they reach a medium height and can be trained by pruning and bending early on in the vegetative stage. Topping -- or trimming the broad fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant -- can help low-lying buds get the air and sunlight they need. Growers may also want to expose Bay Dream plants to cold temperatures just before the flowering stage in order to bring open it visually appealing trademark purple hues. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect a higher than average yield, at about 4 to 5 pounds of flower per plant.\n\nAlthough rare in both medical and recreational markets, Bay Dream is a strong and tasty sativa with some great genetics. Its potent energetic high makes it a surefire choice for those seeking a daytime surge of inspiration.\n\n"

        "description": "Although it has roots in California’s very own OG Kush, Alien OG is an out-of-this-world strain with a reputation all its own. This sativa-leaning hybrid was created by seed company The Cali Connection as a cross between Tahoe OG Kush (itself a phenotype of the original OG Kush) and Cali Connection’s very own indica Alien Kush.  Alien OG offers a soaring psychedelic high with roughly equal parts cerebral stimulation and and physical relaxation. Alien OG’s THC content can range from 20% to as much as 28%.\n\nBuds of Alien OG are packaged as small, nugget-like clusters. Although the flowers often have a dense, compact bud structure, some phenotypes lean more sativa and have looser, fluffier leaves. The leaves themselves appear light green and are offset by orange to vibrant red pistils, which are structures that allow the female plants to catch pollen for fertilization. As evidenced by their high THC content, flowers of Alien OG are resinous, covered in trichomes that make them appear moist and frosty. This strain has a surprisingly sweet, citrus-like smell, with notes of lemon wafting up from the cured buds. There are also more subtle notes of earth and fresh pine. When combusted, flowers give off a more spicy, hashy scent typical of the OG family. The smoke is lung-expanding but very smooth. Smokers may taste hashy incense and a faint tang of ammonia on the exhale. This is one pungent strain, and its odor can linger for a while after it’s smoked; this might not be the right choice for any smokers trying to keep their consumption discreet.\n\nThe high from Alien OG is said to come on quickly as a bracing pressure behind the eyes. This head rush is accompanied by a sudden change in cognition, as thoughts race in rapid-fire association. The intensity of this cerebral effect is often determined by user’s set and setting or by their individual tolerance. In cases where a smoker is able to comfortably settle into Alien OG’s altered state, the high can take on psychedelic proportions: visual distortions like enhanced colors or peripheral flashes can happen, as can the trippy sensation of time moving more slowly. Physical relaxation sets in as the high progresses, or as users consume greater amounts. This strain can be as energetic or as relaxing as smokers intend -- as easily enjoyed out among friends as it is vegging out alone. Alien OG’s well-rounded high also lends itself to several medical applications. Its euphoria can be a boost for those struggling with depression, while its ever-present cerebral nature can be grounding and mindful for those with stress, anxiety, or PTSD. Its palpable body stone, while not immobilizing, can be helpful in relieving chronic aches and pains and even nausea. In high enough doses, Alien OG can even be an effective means of banishing insomnia and lulling users into a deep, refreshing sleep. Because of its “racey” properties, however, this strain can sometimes lead to a kind of paranoid, recursive thinking for smokers who are inexperienced or prone to anxiety.\n\nAlien OG’s creators at Cali Connection have made seeds of the strain available for sale. It is a moderately difficult grow, and may not be the best for newcomers to cultivation. Better grown indoors than out, this strain is known to have trouble developing a root system, and may require potting with rockwool and a significant amount of nutrients when first planted. The short, bushy plants may also require topping, by trimming large fan leaves in order to allow light and air to reach flowering nodes on the lower branches. Alien OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers an average yield.\n\nOnce they’ve harvested, growers should also take care to properly cure their flowers to preserve this strain’s high composition of THC. Curing is a two-stage process that involves first hanging flowers upside down for 7-10 days in a room with 50% humidity and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then, once stems snap easily off the flowers, sealing the buds in clean, airtight jars in a space that maintains 70 degree temperatures and 60-65% humidity.\n\nLike parent strain Alien Kush, Alien OG has certain mind-bending properties that make it an attractive strain for potentially trippy activities like nature walks, music appreciation, or just intense conversation. Its great taste and balanced high make it a welcome addition to the ever-expanding OG family.\n\n"

        "description": "Cookies and Cream (or Cookies N Cream) is a smooth and sweet-tasting hybrid that offers a long-lasting and balanced high. Created by breeders Exotic Genetix, this strain is a cross between two hybrids: pungent Starfighter and an unnamed one of the many different phenotypes of Girl Scout Cookies. Although Cookies and Cream can lean sativa or indica depending on the pheno, it provides an ideal combination of both cerebral and physical effects. This flavorful flower took First Prize in the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup for Best U.S. Hybrid. Cannabis laboratory Analytics 360 has consistently found flowers of Cookies and Cream to have a THC composition of 20% to an impressive 25%.\n\nBuds of Cookies and Cream are small to medium-sized and do not typically adhere in large, chunky clusters. When properly cured, the flowers appear medium to dark green, and yellow pistils are threaded in and out of the densely-packed leaves. Icy white trichomes dot the flowers, making buds only slightly sticky and still easy to break apart. Cookies and Cream’s name promises a dessert-like flavor profile -- and with a sweet, vaguely vanilla scent, these flowers don’t disappoint. There’s also a hint of sourness that may remind smoke aficionados of staple strain Cheese. When burnt, this strain hits easily with a very smooth smoke. Users may notice a creamy mouthfeel on the inhale. Cookies and Cream leaves a nutty, toasted flavor when exhaled. Parent strain Starfighter also imparts some lingering skunkiness, so any smokers trying to keep their consumption secret should take the necessary precautions.\n\nThis strain has a high that mounts gradually, beginning as a dizzy lightheadedness and progressing towards full body relaxation. While they savor Cookies and Cream’s taste, users may begin to notice a pressure around the temples. Rather than analytical and intense, the mental effects of this strain seem to have more to do with mood. Euphoric feelings may set in, along with intensified sensory perception. These psychedelic sensations are matched by a weightiness in the head and limbs which, if not totally incapacitating, at leaves smokers feeling somewhat lazy. Thorough relaxation is the name of the game here, complented by a kind of dreamy mental stimulation. Cookies and Cream’s semi-narcotic effects make it a great medical strain for a range of physical ailments. Aches, pains, and soreness can melt away even with relatively small doses. In larger doses, this flower can also combat insomnia, lulling users into deep, heavy sleep. Cookies and Cream can also help temporarily relieve some of the troubling symptoms of stress and anxiety disorders, minimizing worries and uplifting mood. Dry mouth, red eyes, and a persistent tightness around the eyes are commonly reported as negative side effects. Since this is a potent crossbreed, a small amount goes a long way, even for more experienced users.\n\nCookies and Cream is typically a difficult, temperamental strain to grow and is not recommended for first-time cultivators. Although it’s lesser-known and clones may be hard to come by, breeders Exotic Genetix have fortunately made seeds of Cookies and Cream available for sale. This plant can be successfully grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing requires warm and semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates, with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Grown indoors, plants reach medium height; any taller phenotypes can be trained to fit within their grow space if their branches are bent and pruned early on in the vegetative stage. Growers should also top their plants by regulating trimming any light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage lower nodes to give maximum yield. Cookies and Cream has a very short flowering time -- grown indoors, plants are ready for harvest within 8 to 9 weeks.\n\nA well-rounded strain that won’t leave you either too couchlocked or too paranoid to function, Cookies and Cream is a great option for any time of day. It’s equally enjoyable in social and solo settings, as long as smokers are in a relaxed setting and maintain a positive outlook. Although it may inspire some creativity, Cookies and Cream is probably not the best flower to smoke if you need to need the motivation to blow through your to-do list. Instead, use it to enhance a long, aimless walk or a binge-watching session.\n\n"

        "description": "Double Dream is a hybrid that rides the coattails of a well-known parent strain to achieve a great taste and balanced effects. So named because it doubles down on Blue Dream, Double Dream is a cross between Blue Dream itself and Dream Star (which is sativa-dominant cross between Blue Dream and Stardawg). The result is a fruity sativa-dominant hybrid with a mellow, balanced high that will indeed leave you dreamy. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Double Dream to have an average THC content of 20%.\n\nBuds of Double Dream have a bud structure that is thick and dense, showing the influence of its indica genetics -- but its soft and fluffy leaves lean sativa and are more wispy than tightly coiled in on themselves. The flowers are light to vibrant green in color and, like Blue Dream, do not show the blue-purple hues so often associated with grandparent strain Blueberry. Orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from male pants -- stand out against the monochromatic leaves. A silvery coating of trichomes covers the buds and renders them very sticky; this variety is very hard to break apart without a grinder. When cured properly, the most prominent scent of Double Dream is tangy blueberry. The fruity odors are undercut by some spice and funk as well. The smoke from this strain is known to be harsh when burnt with a hash-like fragrance. Exhaled, Double Dream taste sweet with some herbal notes.\n\nThis strain is said to take hold slowly -- it may be 15 minutes before some users feel the full effects. A strong buzz moves gradually down from the head and spreads throughout the body, culminating in a comfortable meld between physical and mental relaxation. Although Double Dream leans sativa, its effect on the brain takes the form of rambling creative inspiration more so than cerebral stimulation. Thoughts may be elevated or feel particularly significant, but have a hazy, dreamlike quality that make this a great strain to enjoy during a lazy afternoon or a weekday evening. Smokers may feel open to suggestion and able to enjoy a wide range of activities.\n\nMedically speaking, Double Dream can be useful in relieving incidental aches and pains, due to injury or strenuous exercise. It has also been described an effective painkiller for inflammation due to chronic disease and nerve damage. These same narcotic properties may also have the ability to dull troubling headaches. In large enough amounts, Double Dream can induce a deep and restful sleep, aiding those who suffer from insomnia. This strain’s mental effects can also confer some medical benefits -- its mild euphoria makes it a great option for those with anxiety and mood disorders.\n\nDespite its famous genetics and its easy appeal, seeds of Double Dream are not commercially available. Those who wish to grow this hybrid must obtain clippings from healthy, mature plants in order to grow clones. The plants take their cues from Blue Dream. They can be grown outdoors in humid, Mediterranean-like climates, and are especially resistant to mildew. That said, this strain can also be vulnerable to some insects. Double Dream’s plants grow short and bushy with wide lateral branches, making them easy to grow indoors as well. Growers should “top” plants in the vegetative stage by trimming light-blocking fan leaves at the tops of plants in order to allow encourage growth of buds on lower branches. This variety flowers within a relatively short 8 weeks when grown indoors. Double Dream can also be pungent as it grows -- those trying to keep their grow operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.\n\nDouble Dream suggests that more of a good thing isn’t always a bad thing -- the extra dose of Blue Dream in its genetics makes this a doubly tasty and relaxing smoke. Its ideal balance of mellow bodily effects and thoughtfulness can be enjoyed at any time of day. This strain’s flavor is also great to share with friends -- or with friendly strangers as an icebreaker. The surreal but functional high offered by Double Dream is a great example of what careful cannabis crossbreeding can achieve.\n\n"

        "description": "Science fiction and fantasy have had a considerable influence on the naming and marketing of cannabis strains. Romulan, Deathstar, Skywalker, and Alien Kush have all become popular varieties -- and even if they don’t give you a new appreciation of the genre, will at least make you feel like an extraterrestrial being yourself. Now, indica-heavy hybrid Dr. Who will allow you to experience a special sort of time-travel. Named after the long-running BBC sci-fi series, Dr. Who is a potent cross between dynamic sativa Timewreck and flavorful indica Mad Scientist. It was created by Pacific Northwest-based breeders Homegrown Natural. This is a particularly potent strain, with a THC content that ranges from 20% to a whopping 30%.\n\nDr. Who typically has small to medium-sized buds that hold a dense and heavy structure, typical of indicas. It is distinguished by earthy green leaves that are shot through with a vibrant shade of purple. Almost all phenotypes of Dr. Who show these purple hues, which are the result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments stimulated by unusually cold weather during the growing process. Trichomes dust the surfaces of the flowers and are also visible on the insides of buds if they’re broken open -- in all, Dr. Who is very sticky when properly cured. The primary smell of this strain is dank and reminiscent of wet earth. There are also some traces of sour lemon and other tropical fruits lingering underneath. When combusted, the flowers have a harsh smoke which can induce heavy coughing and can sting the sinuses. On the exhale, this smoke has a notably sweet and tangy taste. Interestingly, not all phenotypes of Dr. Who will smell or taste like grape, as the pigments that dictate this strain’s color do not have an effect on its flavor.\n\nDr. Who has a high that mounts slowly and is eventually made obvious by a heaviness in the head. Users will also detect a sharpening of the senses -- sounds, smells, colors, and even tastes may seem more dynamic and intense. Appropriately enough for a strain named after a time-hopping humanoid, Dr. Who may also confer a strong sense of time dilation. Any changes in perception are more relaxing than energizing, in synch with Dr. Who’s mellow body buzz. As the high progresses, this relaxing stimulation of both body and mind can take any direction the user prefers -- it’s a great choice for embracing creativity, taking a long walk, or just having a rambling conversation with friends. Medically, Dr. Who has mostly physical applications. It’s a great way to melt away mild aches; it can even dull pain associated with serious diseases like fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. When consumed in large enough amounts, it can also be an effective treatment for insomnia. Side effects include dry mouth and heavy, droopy eyes -- although couchlock isn’t often reported, and this strain’s mellow character means that there’s a low risk of paranoia. Dr. Who’s high THC content makes it a potent strain for novices and experienced cannabis users alike.\n\nDr. Who can be grown from commercially-available seed. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out. Outdoors, it has the advantage of being resistant to mildew, but requires consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It flourishes indoors, where growing conditions can be more easily controlled. Characteristic of indica varieties, plants of Dr. Who tend to be short and bushy with wide lateral branches. When mature, it sports large buds which may require supports like stakes or dowels to keep them from drooping on their branches. In order to bring out this strain’s eye-catching purple and blue colors, growers should “shock” plants by exposing them to cold late in the vegetative stage. Dr. Who flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.\n\nDr. Who’s balanced high and unique fruity-hashy taste make it a quality cross between two distinctive varieties. Its relaxing but clearheaded high can be a great addition to either social or solo settings. Its very high trichome production also makes it a great strain for producing hash and other THC concentrates. For a meta treat, pair this hybrid with an episode of Dr. Who itself -- but steer clear of anything involving those terrifying Weeping Angels.\n\n"

        "description": "Gelato is a hybrid crossed from taste-engineered parents Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies and fruity indica Sunset Sherbert. With a balanced, mellow high and a universally appealing flavor profile, this is a great strain for social use. San Francisco creators Cookie Fam Genetics have released multiple numbered phenotypes of Gelato - phenotype #33 has picked up the nickname Larry Bird in reference to the legendary player’s jersey number. This strain has an indica-leaning high and carries a THC composition that ranges from 20% to 25%.\n\nGelato’s buds tend to be small but they have the thick and dense structure characteristic of many indica varieties. This is a strain with immediate visual appeal: bright orange pistils stand out against forest green leaves that are accented by shades of deep purple. The purple hues come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather in the vegetative stage. Although the buds themselves are sticky, short stalks on the trichomes mean that this strain has a less frosty appearance than many others. Cured properly, flowers of Gelato have a predominant smell of pungent citrus, compliments of fruity parent strain Sunset Sherbert. Notes of yeast and dough can be detected as well. Grinding up or breaking apart the flowers gives off a more herbal, earthy profile. Though it’s thick and lung-expanding, the smoke from Gelato is smooth and leaves behind a soft and creamy sensation -- perhaps going some way towards explaining its name. This is one pungent smoke, and those trying to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.\n\nGelato is known to hit users quickly, sometimes taking effect before they’ve had a chance to even exhale. The most striking effect is a sense of altered perception and confusion, forcing smokers to adapt to their newly intensified surroundings. This head rush is met by a palpable body buzz that discourages much activity but still leaves users mobile and not couchlocked. Some describe Gelato as having amplified psychedelic effects like time dilation and sound sensitivity. The floaty and comfortable but still lucid feeling conferred by this strain makes it great for daytime or early evening use. Medically, Gelato has value as a way to treat chronic aches and pains with its powerful numbing effects. Some use it to medicate headaches and migraines as well. This strain’s carefree elevation of mood can also offer temporary relief from the troubling symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Gelato is said to be potent, even for more experienced cannabis users; newcomers should temper their consumption accordingly. That said, because of its lack of intense cerebral effects, this strain is not likely to put users into a deeply paranoid mindset.\n\nSeeds of Gelato are not commercially available, meaning that prospective growers may need to obtain plant trimmings in order to cultivate clones. If samples of Gelato are obtained, the strain can be particularly difficult to grow and is not necessarily recommended for novices. It can be grown in or outdoors. Outdoor cultivation requires consistently warm and humid conditions around 75 degrees Fahrenheit; indoor grow operations are more easily controlled and can accommodate the medium-height plants. In order to bring out this strain’s full purple potential, growers should expose plants to colder temperatures just before the flowering period to stimulate the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments. Gelato flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. Despite limited information on cultivation of this strain, we know that its Thin Mint and Sunset Sherbert parents have higher than average yields. Finally, this strain’s pungency makes itself known during the growing process -- indoor growers should put odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans in place.\n\nGelato has all the smooth and fruity appeal of Sunset Sherbert with the earthy, herbal goodness of Thin Mints. With limited availability and a bold look and taste, this strain falls into an emerging category of west coast craft hybrids that are focused on taste. Carrying multiple desirable traits from its heavily crossbred lineage, Gelato has standout visuals and taste. Its trippy but relaxing vibe makes it a perfect choice for some solo introspection or for chatty socializing.\n\n"

        "description": "Glass Slipper is a very potent, sativa-leaning hybrid that relies on some popular genetics to offer a stimulating high. This hybrid is cheekily named for its famed mother strain Cinderella ‘99, a Jack Herer - descended sativa created by Colorado-based breeders Brothers Grimm. Glass Slipper’s father strain is unknown -- there is some conjecture as to whether the mystery parent is The White, LA Confidential, or even a Pineapple phenotype. What’s certain, though, is Glass Slipper’s potency -- with a THC composition between 20% and 25%, it’s just as conceivable that this strain is named for its glassy coating of trichomes.\n\nGlass Slipper has small to medium-sized buds that take a popcorn-like shape when cured. The dried flowers curl up into a dense, indica-typical structure. This strain’s leaves are unremarkable, appearing green to deep yellow. They are coated in sticky, milky-white trichomes, making this a difficult strain to break up by hand. Whatever Glass Slipper’s flowers lack in appearance, however, they make up for in dynamic aroma. The smell is strikingly sweet and fruity, with particularly tropical notes. A little bit of dank earthiness exists underneath this candy-like profile, reminiscent of Cinderella ‘99 herself. When combusted, Glass Slipper burns smooth and delivers an easy toke with a buttery consistency. This strain’s aftertaste has a leathery, musky quality, and a Kush-like odor hangs in the air long after smokers have finished.\n\nThe high from Glass Slipper sets in very quickly, seizing users with a boost of energy and an uplift in mood. In the right set and setting, many describe a soaring euphoria even before they begin to “peak.” As the high progresses, many will discern that this strain has a mild body stone, but nothing that will threaten to immobilize. Glass Slipper’s sativa intensity may enhance the senses, making experiences like watching TV, listening to music, and even eating food noticeably more intense. Its mental stimulation and encouragement of free associative thinking also make this a great social lubricant, helping the introverted to feel more chatty. This strain’s combination of relaxation and emotional contentment mark it as an enjoyable daytime or early evening treat. Its subtle but grounding body buzz also mellows out its cerebral qualities; users prone to anxiety will not need to worry about jittery paranoia that can come with other strong sativas.\n\nAlthough it may not be the best treatment for chronic physical pain, Glass Slipper does have medical application for some psychological conditions. The surging sense of emotional well-being can be a great way to temporarily relieve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even PTSD in some cases. Its clearheaded cerebral nature also makes this strain a great way for those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus. Glass Slipper can even be a popular appetite stimulant -- which, depending on an individual user’s priorities, may either be either a help or a hindrance.\n\nRetailer Dutch Riot sells packaged seeds of a Glass Slipper variety that crosses Cinderella ‘99 with Pineapple ‘99; any other Glass Slipper varieties may need to be cultivated as clones, from clippings of existing plants. This can be a novice-friendly strain to grow. Outdoors, it requires consistently warm and Mediterranean-like conditions, although, as with Cinderella ‘99, the plants can prove resistant to disease. In controlled indoor conditions, the medium-height plants can be trained to fit within their grow space as long as growers prune and bend branches early on in the vegetative stage. Growers should also “top” plants of Glass Slipper by trimming any light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage growth on low-lying branches. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers moderate to high yields; after all, parent strain Cinderella can yield as much as 84 grams -- or 3 ounces -- of flowers per square foot of plant.\n\nAlthough it’s relatively hard to come by, Glass Slipper is universally praised for its taste and comfortably cerebral high. Its creative flow makes it equally enjoyable alone or in lively group settings. Like Cinderella’s legendary shoes, though, Glass Slipper is probably best savored before midnight, as its energizing properties may keep you wired as bedtime approaches.\n\n"

        "description": "Key Lime Pie is a potent hybrid with a unique taste. Its high leans toward the mellow indica end of the spectrum. Although its name implies some kind of connection to Cherry Pie, Key Lime Pie is actually a distinct phenotype of famed strain Girl Scout Cookies -- much like Thin Mints and Animal Cookies. California-based breeder Burnish Bush Nurseries takes responsibility for cultivating this variety. Cannabis testing lab Analytics 360 has consistently found Key Lime Pie flowers to have between 20% and a whopping 25% THC composition.\n\nKey Lime Pie produces small to medium-sized buds that adhere in nugget-like shapes. The buds have the tight, dense structure characteristic of indica-dominant varieties. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green. Some phenotypes even have purple hues which stand out in contrast. The presence of purple in Key Lime Pie flowers is due to a high genetic concentration of pigments called anthocyanins, which are activated when plants are exposed to cold weather in the vegetative stage. If cured properly, this strain is very sticky and can be difficult to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. In addition to its striking visuals, Key Lime Pie also boasts a complex flavor profile. Most immediately, the buds have a fruity, slightly sour odor which may remind many of citrus or lime. Underneath these top notes are vaguely herbal scents -- some may detect the same minty freshness associated with Key Lime Pie’s cousin strain Thin Mints. Burning the buds shows off the OG genetics and gives off hints of spice and musk. Notably, this strain is not known for having a grape-like taste; the same anthocyanin pigments that produce its purple leaves are not responsible for any nuances in flavor. Key Lime Pie burns smooth, and on the exhale, leaves the impression of a sweet and sour candy mixed with some spice.\n\nThis is a fast-acting strain and can strike users before they’ve even finished savoring its strange taste. A deep and heavy relaxation in the face is the most obvious initial effect; this feeling of calm soon spreads throughout the body, relieving tension and allowing users to breathe easily. Although smokers may feel some mental stimulation, the overall feeling is more dreamy than cerebral. A palpable body high pervades, making this a perfect strain to enjoy on a lazy day indoors or at night after a long day of work. In large enough doses, Key Lime Pie can leave users -- especially those with a low THC tolerance -- somewhat spaced-out and couchlocked.\n\nIts ability to unleash a wave of relaxation makes Key Lime Pie an ideal painkilling strain for medical cannabis patients. It can dull aches and pains, whether they’re incidental or more chronic and entrenched. It can also be a great way to combat insomnia, lulling users into a deep, refreshing sleep. This strain’s tendency to take the edge off of a frenzied mind also marks it as an effective treatment for some of the symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and PTSD.\n\nSeeds of Key Lime Pie are not commercially available. Instead, this somewhat rare strain must be grown as a clone, from clippings taken from mature and healthy plants. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires consistently warm and humid conditions with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Unsurprisingly, Key Lime Pie’s plants have a bushy indica shape, with strong lateral branching. Growers should practice “topping” in the vegetative stage, which involves trimming light-blocking fan leaves that grow at the top of the plant in order to encourage maximum flowering in the lower branches. To bring out this strain’s eye-catching purple colors, growers may also want to artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to cold just before flowering occurs. Key Lime Pie flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect an average yield.\n\nWith a dynamic taste and a balanced but slightly lazy high, Key Lime Pie is a great strain to share with good friends or to unwind with alone. Its distinctiveness as a phenotype of an existing strain is proof of the surprises that focused cannabis cultivation is capable of offering.\n\n"

        "description": "Jet Fuel is a pungent sativa-leaning hybrid whose aggressive name serves as a fairly accurately description of its fast-paced sativa high. This strain is a cross between super-sticky Aspen OG and Skunk-derived High Country Diesel, both pungent varieties themselves. Also known as G6, it was created by Colorado-based breeders 303 Seeds. Jet Fuel’s cerebral intensity is well suited to situations that call for deep creative thinking and problem solving. It has a THC content that ranges from 15% to 20%.\n\nBuds of Jet Fuel are marked by medium-sized flowers that taper down into almost conical shapes. The bud structure is more sativa than indica, with relatively light and fluffy leaves that tear away easy from central stems. The leaves themselves are an earthy brownish-green, while the pistils range from orange to rarely-seen shades of maroon and red. When properly cured, flowers of Jet Fuel are covered in trichomes and leave behind a sticky resin when handled. This strain’s name doesn’t only account for its energetic nature, it’s also a reference to the sweet tang of gasoline that wafts from the flowers. Like parent strain High Country Diesel, Jet Fuel packs a fuel-like chemical punch. Grinding or burning the sticky flowers gives off a whiff of pine as well, calling to mind Jet Fuel’s OG Kush lineage. As with many other sativas, the smoke generated by this strain is smooth, although the skunky diesel aftertaste may leave many smokers reaching for a glass of water. This pungent flower may not be the best choice for those looking to keep their consumption discreet.\n\nUncharacteristically for a sativa, Jet Fuel may take a few minutes before it blasts off, giving users a surge of energy and euphoria. Some initial physical effects can be detected as a pressure around the eyes and temples, but this strain otherwise lives entirely in the head. If waking and baking, consumers may feel endured with the energy needed to plow through a busy day. In more relaxed setting, Jet Fuel can bring about a stimulating creative environment -- the constant sense of associative thinking can be a great asset to brainstorming, visualization, or just free-flowing conversation. Jet Fuel is definitely not a strain to enjoy before bed time, even for those with a high tolerance for THC.\n\nMedically speaking, Jet Fuel can have psychological benefits for patients. The acute sharpening of the senses can be a big asset in helping users live more fully “in the now” if they're burdened by symptoms of stress and anxiety. This strain’s cerebral focus can also aid those with attention deficit disorders. Because of its potency and its tendency to induce recursive, obsessive thinking, Jet Fuel is not recommended for patients or recreational users who are prone to anxiety or paranoia.\n\n303 Seeds has made packaged seeds of Jet Fuel available online; it can also be grown as a clone if clippings are obtained from a mature plant. This is considered a moderately difficult variety to grow -- it requires close monitoring of temperature and humidity and, as such, growers may have more success tending to it indoors. Growers should also “top” their plants, cutting away any broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching the lower branches. Jet Fuel flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a somewhat lower than average yield, at about 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\nGrowers should also take care to properly cure the harvested buds in order to preserve Jet Fuel’s taste and potency. This process involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.\n\nWith a racing head high and an aroma reminiscent of a piney car freshener, Jet Fuel is sure to turn some heads of its broken out at a party. This is not a nighttime smoke -- unless  you're planning on a long and active night followed by an inevitable crash.\n\n"

        "description": "You might never think to pair cookies with orange juice, but that’s exactly what breeder Obsoul33t has done with his flavor-focused hybrid Orange Cookies. Obsoul33t’s current endeavor Franchise Genetics (already known for its cultivation efforts with various Alien lines) developed Orange Cookies as a cross between Girl Scout Cookies and Orange Juice. Alternatively, some claim that a phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies called Forum Cookies -- and not Girl Scout Cookies itself -- is this strain’s parent. In any case, Orange Cookies’ potency and bag appeal are clear -- it won 2nd Best Hybrid Flower in the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup and carries a THC composition that ranges from 15% to 20%.\n\nOrange Cookies has medium-sized hairy buds that hold the dense structure typical of indica varieties. Its leaves are a bright green punctuated by hints of purple; this latter color is the product of pigments called anthocyanins in the leaves reacting to colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Orange pistils contrast with these colorful flowers. This strain’s high resin content is made obvious by the presence of a coating of milky-white trichomes that makes it sticky and particularly difficult to break up by hand. Orange Cookies has an arresting smell to match its striking visuals. An overpowering smell of fresh and tangy citrus wafts up from the buds; it may remind some cannabis aficionados of pungent sativa Tangie. Breaking or grinding up the dense buds brings out a peppery herbal kick to complement the smell of orange zest. When combusted, flowers burn smooth and have a pleasantly sugary-sweet taste on exhale with a hint of funk. Notably, despite Orange Cookies’ purple hues, no grape or berry flavors are present -- the pigments that determine this strain’s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.\n\nOrange Cookies’ effects take hold of users quickly, with a buzzy and energetic feeling in the head. This rush is soon met with a palpable body high that is relaxing without being too heavy or immobilizing. As users settle into the high, they may feel motivated and more thoughtful than usual -- but this strain’s stoney indica feeling keeps users grounded, preventing them from careening into an overly cerebral, paranoid experience. Because of these well-rounded effects, Orange Cookies is a great strain for enhancing active pursuits like hiking or exercising, as well as more contemplative, creative tasks. It is as enjoyable as a daytime “wake and bake” strain as it is at night.\n\nIts versatility also makes Orange Cookies a valuable strain for medical cannabis patients. Its contended and lucid mood elevation can be a great way to relieve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety; as a bonus, its middle-of-the-road effects mean that those already suffering from anxiety need not worry about paranoia. Orange Cookies’ numbing body high can relieve chronic aches and pains. If higher doses are consumed, it can also help bring about deep and refreshing sleep. Depending on the individual user’s tolerance, undesirable side effects include the standard dry mouth and bloodshot eyes.\n\nSeeds of Orange Cookies are not yet available for commercial sale, making this a “clone only” strain; prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of Orange Cookies in order to grow genetically identical crops. It can be successfully grown indoors or out, although, as with any cannabis strain, indoor grow operations afford more exacting control over ambient conditions. Growers should make sure they top off the short, bushy plants, trimming any broad fan leaves that could block light and air from reaching the lower branches. When grown indoors, Orange Cookies flowers within 7 to 9 weeks and offers growers a low to medium yield of flowers. As with parent strain Girl Scout Cookies, the plants may need staked supports like wooden dowels in order to keep its flowering buds from drooping on overburdened branches.\n\nIt may not help prevent scurvy, but Orange Cookies is a great choice for some mellow, thoughtful unwinding at any time of day. Its deep flavor and high resin production also makes it valuable in the production of aromatic hash and other concentrates. Sharing this strain’s citrus goodness with friends or enthusiastic acquaintances is sure to win you some gratitude.\n\n"

        "description": "As powerful as Don Corleone or Tony Soprano but nowhere near as intimidating, Mob Boss is a balanced hybrid with strong genetics. It is a cross between the famed Chemdawg D and Tang Tang, a hybrid created by Grindhouse Medical Seeds. Mob Boss tends to lean sativa, with a somewhat cerebral high, but different phenotypes of this strain may offer users different effects. Mob Boss’ THC content ranges from 15% to 20%.\n\nMob Boss is marked by small to medium buds that have a somewhat tapered, conical shape. The buds are very dense when properly cured, with the light green leaves tightly coiling in on themselves. Red hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants -- are threaded through the leaves. These already-colorful flowers are covered in trichomes, lending them a silvery and moist-looking sheen. As a result, buds of Mob Boss can be very sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. The smell of sweet citrus jumps off of these flowers, with herbal notes lurking just underneath. Breaking open or combusting the flowers gives off a more musky odor. The smoke from this strain is harsh and cough-inducing and can sting users’ eyes and sinuses. On the exhale, the overall impression is a mix of sweet and sour flavors that tends to linger on the palate.\n\nMob Boss is known to take hold of users quickly. It begins as a head buzz that is accompanied by an intensification of the senses -- smokers may perceive sounds and colors differently. After adjusting to this altered state, many find that this strain has a strong cerebral character that may work well in situations that call for creative thinking or problem solving. This sensory sharpening can also feel psychedelic -- sensations like visual distortions and time dilation are possible. If enjoying Mob Boss in a relaxed set and setting, some might detect a slight body buzz which, while it may not bring about couchlock, will at least engender some relaxation.\n\nAs with its recreational uses, the medical applications of Mob Boss can be both mental and physical. Its ability to elevate mood can have considerable benefits for those suffering from stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Those with attention deficit disorders might also find that Mob Boss allows for increased and sustained concentration. Alternatively, this strain’s palpable indica buzz can be used to treat mild to moderate aches and pains. It can also be a potent appetite stimulant and, in large enough doses, can be used to treat insomnia. A small amount of this strain goes a long way, and those with a lower tolerance for THC should with a low dosage and then adjust consumption accordingly.\n\nA few different companies have released packaged seeds of Mob Boss. It can also be grown as a clone if growers are able to obtain clippings from a healthy, mature plant. This strain can be cultivated indoors or out, but outdoor cultivation calls for Mediterranean-like climates with constant humidity and daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoors, Mob Boss’ height can be trained to a maximum of about 4 feet, as long as growers train their plants by bending and pruning branches early on in the vegetative stage. Additionally, thanks to a favorable leaf-to-bud ratio, growers may not need to trim these plants as frequently as those of other varieties. Mob Boss typically flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers can expect yields of 1.3 to 1.6 ounces (or about 37 to 46 grams) of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nGrowers should also properly cure their harvested buds in order to preserve Mob Boss’ potency and unique taste. The curing process involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in a room that maintains 50% humidity and a consistent temperature of 70 degree Fahrenheit; and then sealing them in wide-mouthed jars in ambient surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity, checking regularly for mold and mildew.\n\nWith a bold high that’s as enjoyable out with friends as it is during a lazy solo afternoon, Mob Boss is a uniquely versatile strain. It can enhance daytime or nighttime activities and its ideal meld of mental and physical effects can serve as an exercise aid, a creative muse, or even an aphrodisiac.  \n\n"

        "description": "Mad Scientist is an indica-dominant hybrid with a skunky, old-school scent and an appealing balance between indica and sativa effects. It can also be an excellent sedative when consumed in larger quantities. Produced by breeders Sannie’s Seeds, it is a cross between the notorious White Widow and Herijuana, a hybrid derived from Afghani landrace genetics. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Mad Scientist to have an average THC content of 15% -- although Sannie’s claims THC levels can reach as high as 24%.\n\nMad Scientist has strikingly large, spherical flowers composed of tightly curled leaves and pistils. The dense, indica-typical buds are hard and solid. Leaves themselves are a mossy green and contrast with a high concentration of bright orange, pollen-catching pistils. Parent strain White Widow passes on a tendency for high resin production, giving these buds a thick coating of silvery trichomes. When properly cured, flowers of Mad Scientist have the heady aroma of citrus and musk. Some acrid skunkiness is present as a base note, likely the influence of Afghani indica roots. When combusted, this strain can have a harsh, eye-stinging smoke that leaves behind the taste of pine and lemon when exhaled.\n\nThis hybrid’s high creeps up, often taking effect well after smokers have finished savoring its unique taste. Effects begin in the mind, with a notably altered perception of setting; sounds and visuals may appear sharper or more intense. Thoughts may begin to race -- but this strain won’t turn you into an actual mad scientist. Instead, as users adjust to the high, they may experience their surroundings as psychedelic or surreal. Mad Scientist also has some palpable physical effects. As the high progresses, relaxation spreads down from the shoulders and through the core, killing tension and facilitating deep, cleansing breathing. The combination of effects on mind and body makes this a great choice for an afternoon stroll, a creative project, or simply a lazy lounge session. Perhaps unsurprisingly because of its THC content, this can be a potent strain even for more experienced cannabis smokers.\n\nMad Scientist can also be beneficial for medical cannabis patients. Its relaxing physical properties can provide relief from aches and pains -- both incidental, due to injury, or chronic, due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. It can ease headaches and, in large enough doses, can lull insomnia patients into a restful sleep. This strain’s uplifting sativa side can help boost the moods of those struggling against stress or depression. Its feeling of lucid focus can also aid users with attention deficit disorders. Because of the uptick in cerebral activity in early stages of the high, Mad Scientist may not be the best choice for those prone to paranoia or anxiety.\n\nProducers Sannie’s Seeds have made seeds of Mad Scientist available for commercial retail. Prospective growers can also take clippings of mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetic clones. Mad Scientist can be grown indoors or out. Outdoor cultivation requires Mediterranean-like climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. It has short and bushy plants, characteristic of other indica varieties, that can easily fit in indoor grow spaces. This plant should also be trimmed of any high-growing fan leaves that could block air and light from reaching the lower flowering nodes. Mad Scientist flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a solid yield of about 51 grams (or 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Curing the buds -- by first hanging them up to dry and then sealing them in airtight containers with moderate humidity -- can help preserve their sticky trichomes and kushy citrus flavor.\n\nVersatile enough for use at any time of day, Mad Scientist is well-rounded enough to gain a substantial following among fans of hybrids. Its genes have already proved useful enough to cross with buzzy sativa Timewreck to yield the cleverly-named Dr. Who. Mad Scientist’s sky-high resin production also makes it a valuable strain for the production of hash and other concentrates.\n\n"

        "description": "Monster Cookies is an indica-dominant hybrid that builds on some strong and flavorful genetics. This strain is a cross between the omnipresent Girl Scout Cookies and the flavorful and eye-catching Granddaddy Purple. This background gives the flowers a relaxing high and a complex, fruity taste. Although it’s known to be a potent variety, cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found Monster Cookies to have a modest range of 10% to 15% THC composition.\n\nThis strain is distinguished by medium-sized nugs that hold their shape thanks to a dense indica-type bud structure. The sticky and tightly-coiled leaves are predominantly forest green, but are accentuated by deep blue and purple hues -- these vibrant colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Short-talked white trichomes give the bright buds a frosty overlay; they also make this a difficult strain to break up by hand. Monster Cookies has a mostly berry and grape-tinged flavor profile, much like parent strain Granddaddy Purple. Breaking up or burning the buds gives off more of a spicy, incense-like quality, compliments of the OG Kush in this strain’s lineage. Cured properly, it has a smooth, easy smoke that tastes dank and sweet on the exhale. This is also a particularly pungent strain, so smokers trying to keep their consumption under wraps should take the necessary precautions.\n\nMonster Cookies has a high that creeps up on the user, slowly conferring a heavy body stone. The temptation to melt into the nearest possible couch may prove overwhelming for many. Although some cerebral stimulation may occur, this strain’s mental qualities are mostly dictated by its deep physical relaxation. Smokers will feel fully at ease -- content to remain in one place, but uplifted enough to be social and chatty. Because of these trippy, dreamy qualities, Monster Cookies is probably not the best choice for those looking to accomplish work or finish errands.\n\nBecause of this strain’s potency, cannabis newcomers should moderate their initial dosage and then scale up if necessary.\n\nIts almost narcotic effects gives Monster Cookies strong analgesic effects for medical cannabis patients. It can be an effective way to relieve aches and pains -- both incidental from injury or soreness and chronic from conditions like fibromyalgia. It has also been said to soothe headaches and migraines and, in large enough doses, can help users with insomnia to find deep, lasting sleep.\n\nSeeds of Monster Cookies are not commercially available; as such, those looking to grow this strain must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow identical “clones.” It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires Mediterranean-like climates with some humidity and daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Monster Cookies’ plants, like those of many other indica varieties, grow short and bushy with a wide lateral branching system. Growers should look to “top” their plants by trimming any high-growing fan leaves in order to let light and air break through to the dense lower branches. Those looking to bring out the full colorful potential of this strain’s buds should also activate its anthocyanin pigments by exposing the plants to cold weather just before flowering occurs. Monster Cookies flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September or early October when grown outdoors. Although it only offers growers an average yield, its flowers are typically large and may need to be held up by makeshift stakes in order to keep from drooping on their branches. After the long process of cultivation, growers should also properly cure their flowers of Monster Cookies to preserve their potency and bold flavor.\n\nMonster Cookies is a great example of the genetic bounty that the phenomenally popular Girl Scout Cookies continues to yield. It’s a quintessential nighttime smoke whose heavy and dreamy high is best enjoyed alone or with a small group of familiar friends. This flower’s fruity, crowd-pleasing taste and its powerful sedative high may mark it as a new favorite for indica fans. Cookie Monster never got his hands on some Monster Cookies, but we’re pretty sure that if he did, he’d demand more.\n\n"

        "description": "Named for the incredibly sweet bubble gum brand, Bubblicious is a fruity strain with strong indica vibes. It is a distinct phenotype of Bubble Gum, a multiple Cannabis Cup award winner whose mysterious genetics were established in Indiana and then tweaked over several botanical generations in the The Netherlands. Bubblicious was created by Nirvana Seeds, the prolific breeding group responsible for potent strains like Black Jack and Jock Horror.  Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found Bubblicious flowers to have anywhere from 15% to as much as 25% THC.\n\nBubblicious boasts large flowers that taper off into a clear conical shape. The cured flowers adhere in a somewhat fluffy bud structure, with wispy leaves clinging to the central stems. The leaves themselves are spring green with yellow pistils. In some phenotypes, shades of purple and even pink stand out in the flowers; these vibrant colors come about when high genetic concentrations of anthocyanin pigments are agitated by cold weather in the growing process. When cured properly, buds of Bubblicious has an intensely sweet and strawberry-like scent that indeed smells like saccharine bubble gum; it may also remind some users of cotton candy. When broken up, buds also emit some dank, earthy odors. Bubblicious has a smooth smoke that leaves a fruity, skunky taste lingering on the smoker’s palate. This unique strain is particularly pungent --  those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to plan ahead.\n\nBubblicious moves quickly for an indica, conferring a heaviness in the head and limbs. A wave of relaxation may make users move or speak more slowly. Despite this slowdown in physical functioning, however, smokers do not lose mental clarity -- Bubblicious stimulates rapid associations in thinking and can be a great tool for creative work or for solving entrenched problems that may require a new perspective. Bubblicious’ action on both mind and body make it appropriate for many different activities, including exercise, errands, and socializing. Its can be enjoyed at any time of day and is said to be potent even for cannabis veterans.\n\nThis strain has value for medical cannabis patients as well. The newfound thoughtfulness that comes with Bubblicious can help those with moderate anxiety or depression to appreciate their surroundings and to live more “in the moment.” A sustained sense of focus can also be useful for those with attention deficit disorders. Its sedative effects can be a salve for deep-seated pain, whether superficial or chronic and nerve-related while anti-emetic and anti-convulsive properties make this a treatment for nausea. Because it can stimulate recursive thinking at the same time that it promotes relaxation, Bubblicious is not necessarily recommended for use before bedtime to relieve insomnia.\n\nBreeders Nirvana Seeds have made packaged seeds of Bubblicious available for retail. At-home growers can also obtain cuttings from mature plants to serve as “clones.” A hearty plant, Bubblicious is a good choice for novice growers and can be successfully cultivated indoors or out (although outdoor growing requires warm, semi-humid climates). The plants have a characteristically indica shape, short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers should “top off” these plants by trimming away any large leaves that could block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Growers should also bring out the flowers’ full colorful potential by occasionally exposing plants to colder than averages temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within a brief 6 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. As much as Bubblicious is a pungent smoke, it is also a pungent grow, and anyone looking to keep their operations secret should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans. Curing the buds -- by first hanging them up to dry and then sealing them in airtight containers with moderate humidity -- will help preserve their singular flavor and resin production.\n\nBubblicious is popular in Amsterdam where it was initially perfected. It only stands to gain a higher profile in the U.S. market, where evenly-balanced and flavorful hybrids are in constant demand. Nirvana may want to do some damage control in Oregon, though -- in September 2016, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission banned the sale of Bubblicious and several other strains whose names are potentially appealing to children.\n\n"

        "description": "Alpha Blue is a sativa-dominant hybrid descended from the uber-popular Blue Dream and pungent hybrid NYC Diesel. This agreeable, well-balanced strain has inherited the dynamic fruity taste that has made its Blue Dream parent one of the most popular strains circulating today. With Haze, Diesel, and landrace roots, Alpha Blue is as potent as it is tasty -- in 2011, it won the title of 2nd Best Sativa in two different regional High Times Cannabis Cups. Also known as Dream Diesel, this strain carries 15% to 20% THC.\n\nAlpha Blue commands respect with medium to large flowers that taper into triangular, spade-like shapes. The flowers also have the distinction of looking more like flowers than dense, compressed buds. A sativa-typical structure means that the leaves grow off of central stems in tufts and have a fluffy texture and appearance. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are threaded through with red and orange hairs; these hairs are actually pistils, the female plantÔÇÖs reproductive structures that collect pollen from male plants. Notably, Alpha Blue does not seem to have inherited the pigmentation from grandparent strain Blueberry that results in blue and purple hues. This strainÔÇÖs scent, however, is undoubtedly familiar to fans of Alpha Blue and Blue Dream. The smell of sweet blueberries wafts off of the cured flowers. A slightly sour funk from NYC Diesel also imparts a more tart character to the berry smell. When ground or broken up, Alpha BlueÔÇÖs flowers show their Diesel influence even more, with a sweet, fuel-tinged odor. This strain has a smooth smoke when burnt and tastes peppery on the exhale with a lingering aftertaste of sour fruit.\n\nThis is a strain that does not take long to make itself known. After smoking Alpha Blue, users may feel a slight constriction of facial muscles manifesting as a pressure around the eyes and temples. These disorienting physical effects are met with an enhancement of the senses -- smokers might perceive sights, sounds, and even textures more intensely. A spike in cerebral activity is also common, with recursive or freely associative thoughts. Fortunately, any anxiety-inducing sense of ÔÇ£mindraceÔÇØ is mellowed out by a slight body buzz that makes all tension evaporate. That said, this strain will not leave you couchlocked or make you feel out of control of your body.  Alpha BlueÔÇÖs combination of relaxation, uplifted mood, and mental stimulation makes it suited to a wide variety of settings, both solo and social.\n\nMedically speaking, Alpha Blue has both physiological and psychological applications. Its euphoric effects are great for those struggling with symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Its lucid sense of focus is also great for patients with attention deficit disorders. Alpha BlueÔÇÖs subtle body melt, relaxing without being incapacitating, can even relieve deep-seated, chronic aches and pains. This strainÔÇÖs high is said to be particularly long-lasting, even for users with a high THC tolerance.\n\nBecause itÔÇÖs an emerging strain -- and because its provenance and creation is not well-documented -- there is only limited information available on the cultivation of Alpha Blue. With no packaged seeds available for commercial sale, prospective growers must rely on clippings from mature, existing plants in order to grow genetically identical ÔÇ£clones.ÔÇØ Because itÔÇÖs a hybrid, it may be successfully cultivated, although outdoor growing requires warm, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAfter obtaining clones and taking the trouble to grown Alpha Blue, growers should also properly cure their flowers to preserve taste and potency. Curing involves first hanging buds upside down by the stem or lay them on drying racks that provide air circulation for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers easily, buds can then be sealed in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and temperature around 70 degrees. As they cure, the buds should be checked at least daily for a week for signs of mold.\n\nPopular in Colorado and on the West Coast, Alpha Blue stands to gain ground with its genetically-enhanced taste and evenhanded high.`ItÔÇÖs appropriate for daytime or nighttime use and its upbeat, often talkative high is right at home in cannabis-friendly social situations.\n\n"

        "description": "The name Cali Kush (or California Kush) describes at least two distinct strains in wide circulation -- and ironically, neither was produced in California.  One is a balanced pure indica created by the Netherlands-based company Sumo Seeds. The other is an indica-leaning hybrid bred by Anesia Seeds from Spain.\n\nSumo Seeds’ indica Cali Kush is a cross between award-winning Mendocino Purps and staple indica LA Confidential. It has small to medium-sized buds that appear mostly spherical with a tight and dense bud structure. The pale green leaves are streaked with shades of blue and purple which come about when high concentrations of pigments in the plant (likely passed on from the Purps parent strain) are stimulated by cold temperatures during cultivation. Cured flowers of this Cali Kush have a mostly floral, herbal scents with some hints of mint. Smoke is smooth and has a fruity aftertaste.\n\nThis strain has a well-rounded high despite its entirely indica genetics. Users may have initial feelings of thoughtfulness and sharpened perception. Instead of disorienting cerebral mindrace, though, smokers will experience a progressive physical relaxation to ground their thoughtfulness and bring them back down to earth. Cali Kush can serve as an accompaniment to socializing in familiar surroundings or unwinding alone. It has medical application as a means of temporary stress and anxiety relief. Its lucidity and focus can help those with attention deficit disorder to focus on a single task. It can also soothe aching joints and muscles and, in high enough doses, lull those with insomnia to sleep. Sumo Seeds’ creation is suited to use at any time of day.\n\nAlthough Sumo appears to have made seeds of Cali Kush available at some point, the strain has since been discontinued for commercial sale. Prospective growers must obtains clippings from mature, healthy plants to grow genetically identical “clones.” Once rooted, clones can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Anyone looking to bring out this strain’s visual appeal should expose plants to cold temperatures at night just before flowering in order to stimulate their pigments. Conveniently, plants flower within a quick 6 to 7 weeks. They offer growers a medium yield of flowers.\n\nAnesia Seeds’ Cali Kush is a cross between tasty Strawberry Kush and a phenotype of none other than OG Kush. It has medium to large-sized buds that are spade-shaped and, although they have a tight bud structure, have somewhat wispy, fluffy leaves. The leaves themselves are a yellowish-green, set off by pistils that range in color from brown to vibrant orange. This strain’s aroma is predominantly of citrus, with a sweet and somewhat dank base. When it is broken up or ground, some more peppery, Kush-like notes might be evident. This Cali Kush burns with a smooth smoke and when exhaled leaves behind a skunky and overall tropical impression.\n\nAnesia’s Cali Kush has a high that comes on fans for an indica. Smokers may feel a sudden heaviness in the head that spreads through the limbs and core. The quick sedative effects may bring about a desire to lounge in the closest comfortable surroundings. More calming than thought-provoking, this strain’s head high manifests as a pleasantly hazy, dreamy state. For medical cannabis patients, this Cali Kush can have a range of applications. Its mellow vibe can place a damper on the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety, and PTSD. It can also relieve aches and pains, whether they’re incidental, due to injury or exercise, or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis. More of an evening or nighttime treat than a wake-and-bake strain, this bud’s effects may ultimately lead to deep and restful sleep.\n\nLuckily, Anesia has made seeds of their Cali Kush available for purchase online. With strong and varied genetics, this may be a good options for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. It can be grown outdoors, but successful outdoor cultivation depends on a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. The short, indica-typical plants, which rarely exceed 3 feet in height, are very manageable in indoor grow spaces. Growers should be sure to “top off” their plants, trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves to encourage flowering among lower branches. This Cali Kush flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid September when grown outdoors. It offers growers high yields of about 51 to 60 grams (or 1.8 to 2.1 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\n"

        "description": "C4 is a hybrid that leans slightly indica but has overall balanced effects. It is a cross between Afghani-descended indica Shiskaberry and the sweetly-scented Cotton Candy Kush. It is the creation of the Vancouver-based Chimera Seeds, breeders who frequently experiment with Skunk and Blueberry varieties. In addition to having an appealingly earthy scent, flowers of C4 carry a THC content of between 15% and 22%.\n\nC4’s flowers are impressively large and adhere in almost spherical chunks. This variety has a somewhat hybridized bud structure -- although the curly leaves are densely packed at their bases, they have a fluffy exterior texture and can be freely plucked from the central stem. The leaves are a vibrant spring green, with yellow to faint orange pistils that more or less blend in. The big buds are coated in syrupy trichomes, making this an especially difficult strain to break up by hand, fluffy leaves notwithstanding. After they’re cured, buds of C4 have a mellow scent that is similar to moss and cedar. Sharp notes of lemon zest accentuate the predominantly woodsy odor. Breaking up or grinding the buds can give off a hashy, incense-like aroma, evidence of Afghani’s influence in this strain’s genetics. When burnt, C4 has a smooth, rich smoke that tastes of citrus and pine on the exhale.\n\nThis strain offers a ”creeper” of a high that may not make itself known until several minutes after it’s consumed. Smokers of C4 may eventually detect a pleasant slowdown in breathing and a loosening of any tensed-up joints or muscles. This relaxation comes with an emotional uptick that can range anywhere from contentment to soaring euphoria. While C4 may not induce intensely cerebral thinking, it can have create mental stimulation to make listening to music or watching movies a somewhat psychedelic experience. Because it works on both the mind and body, C4 can be a great accompaniment for activities that involve both, like creating art, exercising, and sex. Users should keep in mind that with increased consumption, indica effects take over and can bring about brain fog and couchlock.\n\nIts well-balanced effects make C4 a versatile strain for medical purposes. Not only can C4 take the edge off of a stressful day, it can also blunt the troubling symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Its strong sedative effects can treat aches and pains and it has the capacity to ease stomach pain. In high enough doses, C4 can relieve stubborn cases of insomnia.\n\nAlthough producers Chimera at one point released seeds of G4 for online sale, many suppliers seem to be out of stock. Those who want to grow this strain at home should obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of C4 in order to grow clones. This is a good strain for novice growers, as its landrace genetics make it particularly resistant to disease and mold. It can be successfully grown indoors or outdoors, but outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It fares well in closely-monitored conditions indoors; C4 grows short and bushy with horizontal branching and can fit in relatively small grow spaces. This strain flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield in return for their efforts. In fact, as flowering begins, growers may need to support the drooping branches with supports like wooden dowels.\n\nC4’s versatility makes it suited for use at any time of day. It can provide the inspiration needed to help finish the tasks you’ve been putting off. Alternatively, it can be just the thing to help you zone out after a long workday. Its high resin production means that C4 is a great strain for producing THC concentrates like wax or bubble hash.\n\n"

        "description": "Some strains can catch a consumer’s attention with their provocative names -- indica-heavy hybrid Bordello is no exception. Fortunately, this strain has a stoney potency to match its risque marketing. Bordello’s origins are something of a mystery, with no official commercial presence or documentation to point to its creators. However, it is rumored within digital cannabis cultivation forums to be the brainchild of a breeder named Lonestar who is associated with a collective called the Texas Resin Company. Bordello is said to be a cross between two other strains of mysterious provenance -- Blueberry Apocalypse and Alexis. Bordello’s THC content has been reported to be between 15% and 20%.\n\nBordello’s flowers, though colorful, are not especially eye-catching in terms of size or structure. They are small to medium and hold fragmented, popcorn-like shapes when cured. The tight, classically indica buds are dusted with trichomes, giving them a slightly moist texture and appearance. Leaves are forest green, in contrast to their hairy, bright orange pistils. Many phenotypes of Bordello also appear to show streaks of lavender and violet. The strain’s genetics are predisposed to produce these purple colors because of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins; the pigments yield bright colors when exposed to colder than average conditions late in the growing process.\n\nA complex scent and flavor profile makes the mystery of Bordello’s genetics all the more tantalizing. The flowers give a powerfully tangy citrus scent, reminiscent of Haze varieties like Jack Herer. Consumers may also detect notes of berry, perhaps passed on from the so-called Blueberry Apocalypse parent strain. When broken up or ground, the buds have more of an herbal funk. Bordello gives off a particularly smooth smoke for an indica, and tastes fruity and vaguely piney on the exhale. Notably, this strain does not have a grape flavor to match its purple hues; compounds called terpenes, distinct from the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments, are responsible for Bordello’s nuanced scent and taste.\n\nBordello has a heavy, languorous high that may take a while to be fully felt. After a few minutes -- or after a second hit -- smokers may feel a mounting pressure around the eyes and sinuses. Rather than plunging into cerebral intensity, however, users will slide into a pleasantly hazy mindset. Palpable relaxation creeps throughout the body, slowing breathing and releasing muscle tension. This newfound sedation can create some confusion and brain fog. This strain is not the best choice for accomplishing tasks that require significant exertion. That said, Bordello may provide sufficient relaxation for users to feel friendly and chatty -- even those with social anxiety disorders. Because it can be somewhat incapacitating, Bordello is not recommended for morning or afternoon use, and is better suited to helping users unwind before bed.\n\nBordello’s sedative effects also make it an effective treatment for all kinds of ailments. Its body buzz can numb both moderate and several aches and pains. It can even have anti-convulsive properties for those with seizure conditions. Bordello’s easy feeling of contentment is very useful for soothing stress, anxiety, and depression, and in high enough doses can even provide relief from insomnia.\n\nSeeds of this strain are not available for commercial sale. Those who wish to grow Bordello at home must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow “clones,” or genetically identical propagations. Because of this strain’s limited documentation, there isn’t much information on its ideal growing conditions. However, because it’s an indica, Bordello likely has a short, bushy plant structure that can easily be grown indoors. If they’re able to foster clones, growers should trim any broad, light-blocking fan leaves in order to allow low-growing nodes to reach maximum flowering potential. Growers should also accentuate this strain’s purple highlights by exposing the plants to cold nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Bordello is reported to have an average yield of 36 grams (or 1.4 ounces) per square foot of plant.\n\nDespite its obscurity, Bordello is an excellent choice for intimate nighttime relaxation. Its dynamic, citrus-inflected taste also makes it a novel strain to share with good friends. Whatever you do, though, don’t plan on having an active or mobile smoke session -- Bordello allows you to lounge in sleepy, heavy-bodied luxury.\n\n"

        "description": "Blueberry Pie is an indica-leaning variety with a genetic claim to fame -- two of the most popular strains circulating today, Girl Scout Cookies and Blue Dream, come together to yield this potent and flavorful hybrid. Equal parts cerebrally intense and physically relaxing, Blueberry Pie is well suited to use in a variety of contexts. It’s a great example of what cannabis crossbreeding has to offer. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found at least one sample of Blueberry Pie flower to have approximately 20% THC content.\n\nBlueberry Pie is distinguished by medium-sized, spade-shaped nuggets. The flowers hold the tight bud structure that is so typical of indica strains, with compact, tightly-coiled leaves and a dense weightiness. The flowers themselves are an earthy brownish-green with yellow pistils. Some phenotypes may show off vibrant shades of purple, a color passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry that is caused by large concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins that trigger blue and purple hues when exposed to cold temperatures during the growing process. Also passed on from the Blueberry and Blue Dream strains is the unmistakable scent of fresh blueberries, a fruity tang that jumps off of the dried buds. Some dank and musty notes hang underneath this sweetness and speak to the funky Kush legacy, passed on from Girl Scout Cookies. When combusted, Blueberry Pie has a smoke that is thick and lung-expanding but smooth. On the exhale, this smoke has a lingering flavor of overripe fruit, sweet and skunky at the same time. This terpene-heavy strain is known to be particularly pungent, and smokers looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.\n\nThe high from Blueberry Pie sets in quickly and begins as a headrush -- before they’ve even finished savoring this strain’s taste, users may feel a growing pressure behind the eyes and around the temples, accompanied by a marked increase in thoughtfulness. A sharpened perception of smokers’ surroundings can manifest with trippy and psychedelic sensations like visual distortions or intensifications of sounds. As users find their brains pushed into a stimulated, free-associative mode, they may also feel more chatty or giggly. As the high wears on, however, Blueberry Pie’s cerebral high is grounded out by a powerful body stone. Heavy limbs and a tingling sensation may make users want to sit down if they’re not already doing so. A calm (but still clearheaded) mindset takes over, creating feelings of relaxation and contentment. Blueberry Pie’s high can be channeled into whatever pursuit users prefer -- it can provide daytime motivation to accomplish a lengthy to-do list, or can creative the perfect environment for creative thinking or problem solving.\n\nBlueberry Pie also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its holistic, all-over buzz can be a great way for those suffering from depression, anxiety, or PTSD to gain a new perspective and temporarily live “in the moment.” Its sense of focus can also be beneficial for those with attention deficit disorders. Physical effects include relief from aches and pains -- whether incidental and caused by injury or chronic and nerve-related, due to disease. In high enough doses, Blueberry Pie can also be an effective insomnia treatment.\n\nSeeds of this relatively uncommon strain are not available for commercial sale. Those looking to grow Blueberry Pie at home must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants which can then be grown as genetically identical “clones.” If growers are lucky enough to get their hands on some clones, Blueberry Pie can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation always requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70s. Those looking to bring out this strain’s colorful purple highlights should also “shock” plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures at night, just before flowering. Although limited information is available on cultivation of Blueberry Pie, we know that its Blue Dream and GSC parent strains flower after a long 9 to 10 weeks. Both parent strains also offer a solid yield of about 2 ounces per plant, perhaps providing some indication of what Blueberry Pie growers can expect.\n\nAn ideal wake-and-bake strain or simply a great way to pass a lazy night at home, Blueberry Pie imparts a comfortable glow with its well-balanced high. With excellent genetics from two very popular parent strains, it stands to gain even more popularity beyond its current fan base.\n\n"

        "description": "Conjuring images of tropical drinks and Elvis movies, Blue Hawaiian is a hybrid cross between two potent strains: the perennially popular Blueberry and a Hawaiian sativa landrace. Blue Hawaiian was created by Jordan of the Islands, a prolific breeding operation based in scenic Vancouver Island, British Columbia. This boldly-flavored strain offers a balanced high that combines the best of its relaxing indica and stimulating sativa genetics. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Blue Hawaiian’s THC composition at between 12% and 20% with one test reaching as high as 24%.\n\nBlue Hawaiian has small to medium-sized flowers that, once cured, take clumpy, popcorn-like shapes. Leaves are tightly coiled in a dense and heavy bud structure, typical of indica varieties. The leaves themselves are a bright lime green and provide a contrast for fiery orange hairs threaded throughout the flowers. These hairs are actually pistils, reproductive structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. In certain phenotypes of Blue Hawaiian, the buds are also streaked with blue and purple hues -- these latter colors are the result of high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments (passed on from parent strain Blueberry) that are stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. These colorful flowers are dotted with glassy white trichomes, making them sticky and difficult to break up for joints or pipes without the aid of a grinder.\n\nLike its cousin strains xxxx, Blue Hawaiian has a fruity, tropical scent redolent of pineapple and lemon. Meanwhile, a musky blueberry smell hangs out in the background. This strain burns smooth and easy, and its smoke leaves a woody, piney taste when exhaled. Notably, blue and purple-tinged flowers of Blue Hawaiian do not necessarily have a blueberry or grape taste; this is because the pigments that determine the leaves’ color does not have any effect on their smell and taste.\n\nBlue Hawaiian has a high that mounts slowly, sometimes taking several minutes to hit users with its force. Smokers may detect a marked improvement in mood, accompanied by a warm tingle that spreads gradually throughout the body. This simultaneous physical and mental relaxation can have psychedelic effects, like visual distortions or the sensation of time dilation. Trippy experiences notwithstanding, users typically feel lucid and able to focus for the duration of the high. As such, Blue Hawaiian can be a great way to complement anything from creative productivity to exercise to sex.\n\nThis strain is also valuable for medical cannabis patients. It can soothe chronic aches, pains, and even headaches. It can stoke hunger for those who have lost their appetite to illness or chemotherapy. And although an average high is free from couchlock, in large enough doses, Blue Hawaiian can bring about deep and restful sleep for those suffering from insomnia. Psychologically speaking, this strain can be effective in temporarily blunting the troubling symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. Its sense of sustained focus can also benefit those with attention deficit disorders.\n\nJordan of the Islands has made seeds of Blue Hawaiian available for sale; prospective growers may also be able to obtain clippings from healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors in closely-monitored conditions or in outdoors in Mediterranean-like climates with average daily temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Because of the sativa in its genes, plants of Blue Hawaiian are medium tall and can reach heights of 5 to 6 feet. When cultivating indoors, growers should train their plants by trimming and pruning branches early on in the growing process. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s full bag appeal should also artificially “shock” its pigments into producing vibrant purple hues by exposing the plants to cold temperatures just before flowering. As is also typical of sativas, Blue Hawaiian takes a long time to flower -- growers should expect to harvest their buds after 9 to 10 weeks when growing indoors. This strain can yield as much as 15 to 30 grams (or ½ to 1 ounces) per plant.\n\nBlue Hawaiian’s long-lasting euphora proves that a strain’s flavor doesn’t have to come at the expense of its potency. This crowd-pleaser is great at any time of day and can be enjoyed while running errands, hanging out with friends, or simply kicking back at home with some of your favorite music.\n\n"

        "description": "Apple Kush is an indica-dominant hybrid that packs a bold flavor to accompany its potent, hazy high. Although this strainÔÇÖs origins and creators are something of a mystery, we do know that itÔÇÖs a cross between pungent staple Sour Diesel and Pure Kush (which is a distinct phenotype of OG Kush, not to be confused with OG Kush itself). This strain offers a multi-faceted high, with an initial cerebral kick that soon mellows into full body relaxation. Flowers of Apple Kush have tested at between 15% and 20% THC content.\n\nApple Kush is marked by medium-sized flowers that are long and almost cylindrical in shape. Cured properly, the buds have a dense, compact structure, with the leaves tightly compressed together. Leaves themselves are a bright green with hints of yellow. The hairy pistils, which appear when in the plantÔÇÖs early growth stages, stand out against the green buds in hues of orange and brown. A thick coating of trichomes, on the surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers, make this strain difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. While the flowers have a certain clean, fruity smell that reminds some users of apples, there are also prominent floral notes. Grinding or breaking up the buds offers a more sour tang, reminiscent of Cheese. When combusted, Apple Kush has an acrid odor and a harsh smoke that might induce coughing and cause eyes to water. On the exhale, this strain rounds out its fruitiness with a spicy musk that betrays its OG Kush roots.\n\nUnlike some hybrids that may blend the psychoactivity of indica and sativa into one balanced, seamless experience, Apple Kush seems to instead affect users in two different stages. The high starts as a quick headrush -- smokers may feel greater blood pressure around their eyes and temples. This physical effect is met with a sudden alertness that may cause users may feel increasingly thoughtful or talkative. As the high wears on though, cerebral stimulation decreases, easing users into an extreme relaxation that can be felt deep in the muscles. Breathing may slow down as tension evaporates. This soothing indica phase of the high comes with a more dreamy mindset is best enjoyed in comfortable, familiar settings. In high enough doses, couchlock can be expected. As such, Apple Kush should be savored during the nighttime or early evening rather than morning or afternoon.\n\nApple KushÔÇÖs sedative effects are of value to medical cannabis patients as well. This strain can ease aches and pains, whether, incidental, age-related, or caused by chronic conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Apple Kush is also known to soothe headaches and stomach problems. Its tendency to bring about relaxation and sleep also makes it an effective treatment for stress and anxiety-related conditions and insomnia.\n\nThis relatively uncommon strain doesnÔÇÖt have the name recognition of its illustrious parents just yet. Seeds of Apple Kush are not available for purchase, meaning that prospective growers need to find existing plants of the strain to take cuttin that can be grown as ÔÇ£clones.ÔÇØ As with many other hybrids, Apple Kush can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor grow setups require warm, semi-humid climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Both the Sour Diesel and Pure Kush parent strains have a long flowering period, so anyone lucky enough to obtain clones of Apple Kush should plan on the plants flowering within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and in late October or early November when grown outdoors.\n\nGrowers should also preserve Apple KushÔÇÖs unique flavor through a two-stage process called curing. Curing first requires trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for a week in 70-degree surroundings with consistent 50% humidity. Once sufficiently dry, the buds should be sealed in airtight containers and stored in slightly more moist conditions of 60-65% humidity; as Ucure, buds should regularly be checked for mold or mildew.\n\nAlthough initially popular in Amsterdam, Apple Kush is gaining ground in the U.S. cannabis market. Its novelty flavor profile and dynamic, easygoing high make it a great choice for hanging with friends or taking some calm and introspective solo time. A bowl of Apple Kush every day may not keep the doctor away -- but itÔÇÖs guaranteed to help users unwind.\n\n"

        "description": "Candy Cane is a mostly indica hybrid with a complicated genetic background and a robust flavor profile to match. Created by the Vancouver-based Crop King Seeds, it is a cross between landrace-derived AK-47, fruity Mango, and the notoriously resinous White Widow. With a balanced high that can lean in whichever direction the user prefers, Candy Cane scores points for its potent and long-lasting effects. This strain carries between 15% and 20% THC.\n\nCandy Cane boasts large flowers that range in shape from spherical clusters to tapered spades. The flowers have somewhat fluffy, wispy leaves that can be tugged off of their central stems. The leaves themselves are forest green and are threaded through with a preponderance of orange hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from male plants). Certain phenotypes of this strain are also distinguished by shades of purple; these vibrant colors are caused by a high genetic concentration of anthocyanins -- pigments like chlorophyll that turn plants different hues of blue and purple when stimulated by cold temperatures. Parent strain White Widow appears to have passed on its predisposition for resin production, as Candy Cane’s colorful flowers are covered in sticky white trichomes. Candy Cane’s aroma is where its appeal really becomes evident. The cured flowers have a sweet and herbal scent, strikingly similar to the peppermint smell of candy canes. When buds are ground up or combusted, they yield a more spicy scent, similar to the earthy incense bouquet of grandparent strain Afghani. Notably, Candy Cane is lacking in any grape-like smell or taste -- this is because the same pigments that turn its leaves purple do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.\n\nCandy Cane takes hold quickly, manifesting first as a change in pulse around the eyes and temples. Users may have an initial feeling of “mindrace,” with thoughts jumping from one to the next. This feeling may make sensory perception feel sharper or more intense. As the high progresses, this cerebral activity slows down into a mellow elevation in mood and thinking. These mental effects are accompanied by a pervasive sense of physical relaxation that melts away any lingering stress. The union of mental and physical properties makes this a great strain for socializing in familiar surroundings or simply staying in with a book or some music.\n\nThis strain’s versatility also makes it useful for medical cannabis patients. Candy Cane’s upbeat nature can be a great temporary treatment for symptoms of stress and depression. Because it allows users to maintain focus, it can also be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders. Calming physical effects may soothe aches and pains -- both nerve-based pain and stomach problems like nausea. The same relaxation of pressure that users may feel around the eyes also makes this strain an effective treatment for glaucoma. Many report Candy Cane to be a powerful appetite stimulant. Because it has some considerable cerebral effects, Candy Cane may lead to recursive thinking and paranoia in larger doses -- as such, those prone to anxiety should consume this strain with caution.\n\nSeeds of Candy Cane are available for purchase online from producer Crop King. The strain’s sturdy landrace genetics -- it has roots in Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and Afghanistan, among others -- make it a good choice for novice growers. It van be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires consistently warm and humid climates. Indoor growing may be more convenient, as plants rarely exceed 3 feet in height. The bushy plants also have a high leaf-to-bud ratio, meaning that growers should regularly trim any broad leaves that might be blocking light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Candy Cane’s purple hues should also artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures at night. This strain flowers within a short 7 weeks when grown indoors and offers a moderate yield. Plants are known to have a skunky pungency throughout their lifespan; any growers trying to keep their efforts discreet should look into odor control measures, like exhaust fans for their grow space.\n\nCandy Cane is appropriate for consumption in the daytime or early evening -- because it can stimulate thoughtfulness, it might not be the best choice right before bedtime. Its minty-sweet flavor and well-rounded, agreeable high make it a particularly good strain for parties or other get-togethers.\n\n"

        "description": "Grape God is an indica-dominant hybrid that redefines bag appeal with its striking visuals and bold flavor profile. It’s a cross between tasty Grapefruit and High Times Indica Cup winner God Bud. Grape God comes to us from Next Generation Seed Company, innovative breeders based in beautiful British Columbia. This strain’s flashy bells and whistles don’t come at the expense of its potency: cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of God Bud to have between 15% and 25% THC content. Its heavy, peaceful body stone is best savored around bedtime.\n\nGrape God boasts tapered flowers that adhere in large single pieces. The buds have a dense indica-like structure, with tightly curled leaves. The leaves themselves are a spring green and, more often than not, are streaked with hues ranging from pale lavender to deep violet; these latter colors come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins (inherited from colorful God Bud) are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. A blanket of icy trichomes covers the eye-catching flowers, making them sticky and difficult to break up without the help of a grinder. As might be expected from its lofty name, Grape God packs the unmistakable scent of grape -- although an underlying sweetness makes the flowers smell more like grape gummy candy than actual grapes. On second inspection, there are also some funky notes of damp earth. The absence of skunky or acrid flavors in this strain makes for a smooth, easy smoke that tastes dank on the exhale. Notably, there is no correspondence between Grape God’s purple color and its grape-like taste: while the color is dictated by pigments, different compounds called terpenes determine the taste.\n\nGrape God may take several minutes -- or a second bowl -- to take hold of smokers. Effects start in the head, with a gradual heaviness that moves down through the neck to the shoulders and limbs. This “stoney” feeling is soon accompanied by a wave of relaxation that helps put users at ease. Provided that they feel safe and are planted in the right set and setting, users may then feel tensions and worries evaporating under Grape God’s indica influence. This strain does not impair cognition as heavily as some more pure indicas, but users may not feel motivated to work on detailed tasks, even if they can maintain focus. Medically speaking, Grape God’s relaxing properties make it very useful to a variety of patients. It can soothe pain resulting from injuries or from chronic conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its pleasant emotional buzz can blunt the harsh symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. This strain can also be a powerful appetite stimulant. Because of the relative lack of intense cerebral effects, Grape God also comes with a lessened risk of paranoia. The high can last longer than average, even for more experienced consumers.\n\nSeeds of Grape God are available from several online retailers. It can also be obtained the old fashioned way, as cuttings from mature plants of the same variety that can then be grown as genetically identical “clones.” This strain can thrive indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing requires a warm, humid climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its short and bushy plants can easily be maintained indoors, but growers should be sure to “top” their crops, trimming away any large, light-blocking fan leaves. Growers should also be sure to bring out Grape God’s signature purple color by “shocking” the plant, or exposing it to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Grape God has a short flowering period of 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Growers are rewarded for their labor with typically high yields.\n\nMore of an evening or nighttime strain than a wake and bake booster, Grape God is a go-to for relaxation and relief. This strain’s memorable smell and taste practically beg to be taken out in public, though. Grape God’s aroma will turn heads in social settings and, if shared, is sure to gain the gratitude of a few people.\n\n"

        "description": "Call it blasphemous, but Jesus OG is one hybrid with the unique ability to elevate both body and mind. Prolific breeding collective TGA Subcool has blessed us with this cross between merious hybrid Hell’s Angel OG and TGA’s own Jack the Ripper. Although certain phenotypes lean toward the cerebral sativa end of the spectrum, Jesus OG confers a high that strikes the ideal balance between mental and physical effects. With a refreshing lemon taste to boot, Jesus OG has a sturdy THC content of 20%.\n\nJesus OG has small to medium-sized flowers that clump in tapered, spade-like shapes. The buds have a typically indica structure, with tightly-packed and coiled leaves that makes the flowers dense and difficult to break up without a grinder. The leaves themselves are a vibrant neon green, with some copper pistils peeking out. A sprinkling of trichomes gives this strain a waxy sheen and a very sticky surface. The primary smell wafting up from these flowers is of lemon, spiked with an ammonia tang -- the impression is not unlike some aerosol cleaners. There’s also a slightly dank and acrid smell that lurks underneath, which is intensified as flowers are broken open or burnt. When smoked, Jesus OG hits smooth. On the exhale, it leaves a lingering taste of herbs and citrus which may be familiar to fans of Jack Herer, Jesus OG’s grandparent strain.\n\nThe high from Jesus OG takes hold quickly: users may detect a head buzz or may feel their eyes inadvertently narrowing. Such effects are soon met with a newfound sense of cerebral focus. Objects or random thoughts can take on a whole new significance. Because it is so thought-provoking, this strain is great as an aid for work that calls for analysis or creativity. There may be some slightly psychedelic effects as well -- as their senses become more attuned to their surroundings, smokers may perceive sounds, colors, or even tastes more intensely. Jesus OG comes with physical sensations as well. At the very least, relief of tension in the muscles and chest can be expected. In higher doses, this strain can even pin users down on the nearest couch.\n\nThese well-rounded effects also have application for medical cannabis patients. Jesus OG sedative properties can provide relief from chronic, troubling aches and pains. It can relieve moderate headaches and more serious migraines. The same relaxation that this strain bestows on users’ eyes can even be an effective treatment for the painful intraocular pressure that comes with glaucoma. Meanwhile, Jesus OG’s euphoric uplift can be a great temporary treatment for those struggling with stress, anxiety, depression and PTSD. Its clearheaded focus can assist patients with attention deficit disorders. However, because of this strain’s tendency to bring about freely-associative thinking, it may provoke panic or paranoia for those not accustomed to the “mindrace” that comes with potent sativas.\n\nFortunately, TGA Subcool has made seeds of Jesus OG available for commercial sale. Prospective growers can also obtain trimmings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow “clones.” Jesus OG can be successfully cultivated indoors or out. The typically tall plants may do well in open-air environments where they can stretch and maximize yield. However, outdoor growing calls for warm, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Indoors, plants will respond well to carefully monitored conditions; their height can be managed to fit in restricted spaces if growers take the time to train the plants, bending and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage. Jesus OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a larger than average yield.\n\nAs enjoyable during the day as it is at night, Jesus OG is great for introspection and for tackling thorny problems that might require a new perspective. Although it works well in many different situations, this is a very social strain that works great at parties, lifting spirits and stimulating conversation. It may not provide you with a profound spiritual experience, but Jesus OG is sure to take you on a pleasant psychedelic jaunt.\n\n"

It is a cross between the “Katsu cut” of Bubba Kush (a distinct phenotype named for the breeder who discovered it) and Rare Dankness’ eponymous strain Rare Dankness #2. The result is a subtly flavored but potent flower that lulls users into a state of full-bodied relaxation. Cornbread has THC levels that range from 15% to 20%.\n\nCornbread’s flowers are small to medium sized and marked by tight, solid buds that betray a typically indica structure. The leaves are a vibrant green, and contrast with rust-colored hairs which are actually the flower’s pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Certain phenotypes of Cornbread have shades of purple as well. This latter color is the result of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins being activated by cool temperatures in the growing process. These colorful buds are entirely coated by trichomes, making them extremely sticky to the touch. This strain has an indefinable herbal scent, with some sharp hints of citrus lurking underneath. Breaking open the resinous flowers shows off some dank, earthy odors -- evidence of the influence of Kush in this strain’s genetics. With an uncommonly smooth smoke, Cornbread tastes spicy and lemony on the exhale; the overall impression is that of a cup of strong tea, and not of any recognizable variety of cornbread. It’s also worth noting that the pigments that give this strain its eye-popping purple hues do not have any effect on its taste -- users expecting a grape flavor profile may be disappointed. Double-bag this strain if carrying it in public, as it tends to be very pugnent.\n\nMore of a midnight treat than a wake and bake breakfast or an evening appetizer, Cornbread has mostly physical effects. Its effects may be slow to take hold, but once they do, they can engender confusion and a kind of brain fog. Smokers may be hit with a temporary pressure in the eyes and sinuses. In comfortable surroundings though, this trippy feeling soon melts into a corporal heaviness. Users can cast off stress and tension and submit to this strain’s powerful body stone. Depending on individual tolerance, couchlock is common and can go so far as to endow consumers with the psychedelic feeling of being disconnected from their own bodies. Cornbread has little tendency towards cerebral, analytical thinking, leaving users agreeable -- albeit not particularly chatty. Definitely not a strain that will aid productivity, Cornbread is better suited to taking the edge off after a long day.\n\nCornbread’s heavy sedative effects make it a clear choice for medical cannabis patients with a range of ailments. Its sense of oblivion can create temporary relief from depression, anxiety, or PTSD. It can ease deep-seated aches and pains and can even be an effective treatment for insomnia. Although the risk of negative side effects is relatively low, this strain’s ability to immobilize users could induce some paranoia or panic if it’s consumed in public or in a situation where tasks need to be accomplished.\n\nRare Dankness sells packaged seeds of Cornbread for any prospective growers. Like many other strains, Cornbread could conceivably be grown in or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a balmy and semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants grow short and bushy, and users should be sure to tend to lower branches, trimming any high-growing fan leaves that prevent light and air from reaching flowering nodes at the base. Growers who’d like to bring out this strain’s purple potential should also artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures just before the flowering stage. Cornbread flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield. As noted, this is a pungent variety -- those looking to keep their growing operations discreet should put odor control measures like carbon air filters in place.\n\nThe prolific team at Rare Dankness has already given us winners like the super-strong sativa Ghost Train Haze. With Cornbread, they’ve provided yet another tasty and powerful strain that’s tailor-made for unwinding and drifting off to dreamland. Enjoy this knockout solo or with some close friends.\n\n"

        "description": "Moonwalker Kush is a hybrid with a balanced taste and well-rounded effects, making it a great middle-of-the-road strain for cannabis novices and veterans alike. Although its effects lean toward the lazy indica end of the spectrum, it can also provide creativity and motivation under the right circumstances. This strain is a cross between 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup winner Triple OG (aka XXX OG) and Alien Genetics’ signature hybrid Tahoe Alien.\n\nMoonwalker Kush is distinguished by medium-sized nuggets. The flowers maintain a dense and heavy indica bud structure, with tightly packed leaves and trichomes inside and out. Leaves are an earthy shade of olive green, offset by rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). The dusting of resinous trichomes makes this a sticky flower that’s difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Moonwalker Kush’s primary aroma is dank, much like wet earth and leaves. There are also some notes of hash and black pepper. Breaking open the buds gives off a somewhat unpleasant musk that some experienced smokers might find similar to Cheese strains. When burnt, Moonwalker Kush creates a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, users may detect a spicy lingering aftertaste.\n\nA bit of a creeper, Moonwalker Kush has effects that mount slowly, eventually hitting users with a tingle that begins in the head and moves throughout the body. There is an initial sense of disorientation -- senses may feel sharper and users can perceive sights and sounds more intensely than before. Once settled in, however, smokers can enjoy a rambling free association of thoughts. Such cerebral stimulation easily lends itself to creative work or to friendly conversation. Moonwalker Kush comes with some physical effects as well: as the high progresses or as higher dosages are consumed, users will feel this strain’s OG Kush influence in a wave of relaxation. Heavy, numb limbs may provoke the feeling of melting into one’s surroundings, eventually leading to intractable couchlock.\n\nThese far-reaching recreational effects have medical uses as well. Moonwalker Kush can be an effective analgesic for anything from sore muscles to nerve-related pain conditions. It can relieve headaches and migraines and may even have the ability to suppress seizures and spasms. Its unique elevation of both body and mind can mitigate the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, helping patients to appreciate their surroundings and to live “in the moment.” This strain’s sustained sense of focus can also be beneficial to those with attention deficit disorders. In large amounts, Moonwalker Kush brings on sleep, crushing stubborn cases of insomnia. Finally, because its cerebral effects are grounded by a potent body stone, this variety comes with a lessened risk of episodic paranoia.\n\nA recent crossbreed, Moonwalker Kush may be difficult to find outside of the Pacific Northwest. Packaged seeds have not yet been released for sale and clones may be similarly hard to come by. As a result, we have limited information on cultivating this strain. As with any cannabis strain, though, it can be successfully cultivated in controlled indoor conditions or in outdoor operations with semi-humid climates in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range.\n\nAlthough it’s a balanced strain, Moonwalker Kush’s indica leanings make it more suited to nighttime than to morning or afternoon use. Its coveted equilibrium between thoughtfulness and physical stimulation make it a great choice for activities that involve both the body and brain -- including, but not limited to, eating, exercise, and sex. In the right set and setting, Moonwalker Kush may even inspire smokers to teach themselves how to moonwalk.\n\n"

        "description": "What if there are droves of extraterrestrials secretly controlling the White House? Conspiracy Kush is a mostly indica hybrid from Heroes of the Farm, a subset of the growing collective TGA Seeds. Its name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to its genetic lineage: it’s a cross between novelty hybrid Obama Kush and breeder Vic High’s tasty Space Queen. With a memorable aroma and a potent sedative high, this is one flower that deserves to be savored and not quickly consumed. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 puts its THC content at 14% to 25%.\n\nCured flowers of Conspiracy Kush are packaged as small to medium-sized, popcorn-like nuggets. The buds have the tight, dense structure typical of many other indica varieties. The tightly coiled leaves are an earthy shade of yellowish green, although some phenotypes show unexpected shades of purple. This latter, more vibrant color comes about when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process -- a transformation similar to the seasonal changes in foliage due to depleted levels of chlorophyll. Depending on individual phenotype, the flowers are coated in milky white trichomes that lend a slightly moist appearance and a sticky texture. When cured properly, Conspiracy Kush smells like fresh citrus. There are also some dank, sickly-sweet odors of overripe fruit. When burnt, this strain gives off a remarkably smooth smoke that has a spicy, peppery aftertaste. Like its Afghani and OG Kush grandparent strains, this pungent flower’s funk can linger for awhile in an enclosed space.\n\nConspiracy Kush has a surprisingly fast onset for an indica. Users may feel a pulsating pressure in the cheeks and temples, accompanied by a dizzying head high. Despite the initial rush, however, this is not an intensely cerebral strain. Mental effects soon give way to a spreading feeling of relaxation and a sleepy, hazy headspace. Users will feel their worries and tensions dissipate as their head and limbs become increasingly heavy. In a comfortable set and setting, Conspiracy Kush can lead to an intractable feeling of couchlock.\n\nThese restful effects have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Conspiracy Kush is an effective treatment for aches and pains -- both incidental, as triggered by injury or exercise; and chronic, caused by long-term conditions like fibromyalgia and arthritis. Its calming effects can be helpful in treating some symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. It has also been known to relieve headaches and migraines. In large enough doses, Conspiracy Kush is a potent natural remedy for insomnia. Undesirable side effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Due to this strain’s limited stimulation of the mind, paranoia and anxiety are not commonly reported.\n\nTGA Subcool sells seeds of Conspiracy Kush for those interested in growing the strain. It can be cultivated outdoors or indoors. Outdoor growing requires partial humidity and consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoors, the strain’s squat and bushy stature -- typical of other indica varieties -- is easily maintained by steady pruning and bending of tender stems early in the vegetative stage. Growers who intend to bring out Conspiracy Kush’s multicolored potential should artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to colder than average temperatures just before flowering. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a low to medium yield of flowers. It’s also a very pungent variety -- growers should invest in odor control measures like carbon filters or exhaust fans for discretion’s sake.\n\nPost-harvest, growers should take the time to properly cure their flowers. This two-stage process involves first hanging the buds upside down for 7 to 10 days; ambient humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems can easily snap off of the flowers, seal the dried buds in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and a consistent temperature around 70 degrees. After they’re jarred, buds should be checked at least daily to ensure that they haven’t developed mold.\n\nDespite its name, Conspiracy Kush is not likely to leave you trolling Breitbart and Infowars for ridiculous conspiracy theories. Instead, it’ll put you into a thorough and long-lasting body melt. Don’t smoke this strain if you plan on getting anything done -- it’s best enjoyed after dark, either alone or with some trusted companions. Like Heroes of the Farm’s other tasty hybrid Marionberry Kush, Conspiracy Kush is a potent, sleepy addition to the Kush family.\n\n"

        "description": "Royal Kush is a mostly indica hybrid that carries on the prestigious genetics of two classic strains. Created by G13 Labs, a European seed company responsible for many flavor-focused strains, Royal Kush is a cross between staple hybrid Skunk #1 and an Afghani indica landrace. With soothing physical effects and a blissful, dreamy high, this is a variety well suited to mellow nighttime use. According to cannabis testing lab Analytical 360, flowers of Royal Kush have been found to have THC levels of 15% to as much as 25%\n\nThis impressive strain has medium to large flowers that ahdere in elongated, chunky buds. The buds have the tight and dense bud structure typical of many other indica varieties. The leaves are a vibrant spring green with yellowish pistils threaded throughout. Certain phenotypes also have shades of purple, a color that comes about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant are agitated by unusually cold temperatures during the growing process. Milky white trichomes cover the outer surfaces and inner crevices of the flowers and give the cured buds an extremely sticky, resinous texture that makes them difficult to break up by hand. Royal Kush has the full-bodied incense aroma of parent strain Afghani, with notes of pine and sandalwood. Underneath these scents is a sour, citrus-like tinge. When combusted, this strain gives off smoke that may seem remarkably smooth for an indica. On the exhale, users will detect a skunky-sweet taste with a little bit of fruit. Notably, Royal Kush has no discernible grape or berry flavors; the pigments that determine this strain’s purple hues do not have a similar effect on its taste. Like Skunk #1, this is a very pungent variety -- smokers should double-bag their bud when transporting it and enjoy it in isolated locations.\n\nRoyal Kush is a strain that slowly creeps up on the user with full-bodied physical relaxation. In the minutes following consumption, users may feel a tingle in the head and shoulders and shoulders that gradually spreads through the limbs and torso like a wave. Smokers may find themselves breathing and moving more slowly and may feel inclined to veg out in comfortable surroundings. Although some may feel an alteration in their thinking or perception, this takes more of a hazy, rambling character. Psychedelic effects like visual distortions or a sense of time dilation are common.\n\nThese strong sedative properties make Royal Kush a valuable strain for medical cannabis patients as well. Its suppression of stress and tension is a great temporary treatment for acute symptoms of stress, anxiety, and even PTSD. It’s also useful in treating anything from muscle soreness to entrenched nerve pain as the result of conditions like fibromyalgia and Parkinson’s Disease. As more and more is consumed, this strain can lull users into an easy, restful sleep, providing relief from insomnia. Royal Kush is also known to be an effective appetite stimulant. This strain is potent and long-lasting, even for more experienced cannabis users. As such, smokers should consume in moderation at first.\n\nPackaged seeds of Royal Kush can be bought from its creator G13; alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical clones. This strain can be grown indoors or outdoors, although successful outdoor cultivation depends on a consistently warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Royal Kush is a manageable crop indoors, where it reaches maximum heights of 2 to 4 feet. Growers should “top” their plants by trimming any broad fan leaves in order to let light in and stimulate low-growing flowering nodes. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s colorful, eye-catching potential should also expose plants to colder than average temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Royal Kush flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. It offers growers a moderate to high yield of about 46 grams (1.6 ounces) of flower per square meter of plant when grown indoors and 1000 grams (36 ounces) of flower per single plant when grown outdoors.\n\nAlthough it’s not the best choice for powering through a long to-do list, Royal Kush is just the thing for unwinding after a hectic day. Hang out like royalty in a richly-perfumed daze and enjoy some mellow introspection.\n\n"

        "description": "Grape Royale is a flavor-engineered indica hybrid with strong bag appeal. Commercial breeders Barney’s Farm, Apothecary Genetics, and the Seattle-based Royal Tree Gardens all lay claim to this strain’s creation. Despite its uncertain provenance, though, sources agree that Grape Royale builds on the Afghani and Skunk #1 cross utilized by Royal Kush and adds the famous Northern California favorite Mendocino Purple. The result is a bold and tasty flower that confers lasting indica relaxation suited to nighttime use. Popular in the Pacific Northwest, Grape Royale has a reported average THC composition of 18%.\n\nGrape Royale has the dense, heavy buds you’d expect of a landrace-descended indica; a sturdy grinder may be needed to break apart its tightly coiled flowers. Leaves are mostly a pale sea green. As much as its cousin strain Royal Kush has hints of purple, Grape Royale has even deeper violet hues, thanks to the influence of parent strain Mendocino Purple. This intensified color is thanks to a high concentration of pigments called anthocyanins, which produce blue to purple hues when agitated by cold weather in the growing process. You might expect Grape Royale to have a strong and immediate grape scent, but any fruitiness in the flowers plays second fiddle to a deep hashy funk, inherited from grandparent strains Afghani and Skunk. Breaking open or combusting the buds also yields a sour citrus aroma.\n\nWith its strong indica roots, Grape Royale provides potent and lasting relaxation. This isn’t an especially cerebral strain, but what users may lose in focus and motivation, they gain in relief from tension and worry. As the high progresses -- or if greater quantities are consumed -- this strain can even send users into couchlock, causing them to melt into their surroundings. Grape Royale’s sedative qualities make it valuable to medical cannabis patients -- its body stone can block needling aches and pains, dull the troubling symptoms of stress and anxiety, and, in large enough doses, resolve stubborn cases of insomnia.\n\nAs this remains a relatively uncommon strain outside of the U.S. West Coast market, information on growing Grape Royale remains limited. That said, we can infer some likely markers of its cultivation from its popular parent strains. Seeds of Grape Royale are not yet available for commercial sale, so prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow identical “clones.” Like many other strains, it can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. Grape Royale is likely more manageable indoors; the closely-related Royal Kush and Mendocino Purps plants reach maximum heights of 3 to 4 feet. Growers will want to “top off,” or trim any large light-blocking leaves to encourage growth of low-growing flower nodes. Perhaps most importantly, growers should also bring out this strain’s full purple potential by “shocking” the plants, exposing them to cold temperatures late in the growing process -- although it’s important to note that opting to skip this step won’t affect flavor; Grape Royale’s grape taste is determined by its terpenes, not the pigments that dictate its color. Grown indoors, this strain has a short flowering period of 7 to 8 weeks.\n\nAfter successfully growing Grape Royale, cultivators should also take the time to cure their flowers. First, hang the buds upside down or lay them on drying racks for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers relatively easily, seal the buds in airtight wide-mouthed jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and temperature around 70 degrees. While curing, buds should be checked at least daily for a week to ensure that they haven’t developed mold.\n\nGreat for introspective solo use or a lazy, silly night with some good friends, Grape Royale is an emerging indica powerhouse. With a dynamic taste and a smooth, mellow high, it only stands to increase in popularity.\n\n"

        "description": "Kimbo Kush is a powerful indica-leaning hybrid that appeals to users with its fruity taste and its relaxing physical high. Named for the late Kimbo Slice, a larger than life mixed martial arts fighter and boxer, this strain was created by the prolific Exotic Genetix, the same breeders who gave us the tasty Cookies and Cream. Kimbo Kush is a cross between Blackberry Kush and indica heavy hitter Starfighter. It’s known to be a strong and spacey painkiller for cannabis novices and aficionados alike. Cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 has found flowers of Kimbo Kush to have between 15.5% and an impressive 27% THC content.\n\nTrue to its namesake, Kimbo Kush has large, chunky buds that hold a relatively loose and fluffy bud structure for an indica-dominant strain. Its leaves are predominantly a pale spring green; some phenotypes show shades of purple. This latter color comes about during the growing process when unusually cold weather stimulates pigments (called anthocyanins) in the plant -- the process is similar to the way foliage changes color in autumn. These colorful flowers are thickly coated in trichomes, giving the cured buds an icy sheen and making them very sticky to the touch. Deep and fruity notes of citrus and berry waft up from the flowers. There’s also a trace of dank earth, courtesy of grandparent strain OG Kush. When combusted, Kimbo Kush has a remarkably smooth smoke for an indica that tastes sour at first but carries a fruity flavor on the exhale. This particularly pungent strain has a lingering funk, and smokers looking to maintain discretion should take some precautions.\n\nKimbo Kush creeps up slowly, sometimes taking several minutes before hitting users with its thorough relaxation. Smokers may initially feel an increased heaviness in their head and limbs, inspiring them to sit down if they aren’t already doing so. Contended sluggishness follows: users may feel perfectly happy to stay put listening to music or watching TV. Although there may be some psychedelic effects like amplified sounds or time dilation, Kimbo Kush primarily acts on the body, leaving the mind pleasantly foggy. These almost narcotic effects may be as medically effective as they are recreationally entertaining. This strain has the ability to dull chronic aches and pains and to blunt the acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. In large enough doses, it can even be a quick fix for stubborn insomnia. Kimbo Kush is suited to evening and bedtime use. Those consuming during the day should plan on lolling away a few unproductive hours. This is known to be a potent strain, even for experienced smokers; any users should wait a few minutes for the high to take hold before amping up their dosage.\n\nSeeds of Kimbo Kush are available for purchase online from Exotic Genetix; prospective growers can also try and obtain clippings to grow as “clones,” although for the time being, this seems to be a difficult strain to come by. Kimbo Kush can be grown outdoors in climates with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It may be more successful indoors, where growers can meticulously control temperature and humidity. As is typical of indica varieties, this strain’s plants grow squat and bushy, with broad leaves and strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to trim any light-blocking fan leaves in order to let light and air reach the lower flowering nodes. Growers looking to increase their crop’s bag appeal should bring out this strain’s subtle purple accents by artificially “shocking” the plants, exposing them to cold temperatures just before flowering begins. Finally, Kimbo Kush is as pungent during the growing phase as it is when it’s smoked, so cultivators trying to keep their grow operations secret should install odor control measures like exhaust fans.\n\nWith a complex taste and a powerful, enduring high, Kimbo Kush is the perfect choice for some mellow alone time or for a low-key get together with familiar friends. Better enjoyed after dark than consumed as a wake-and-bake strain, it’s great for unwinding after a long day. This strain’s high concentrations of THC can deliver a knockout sedative punch that Kimbo Slice himself would be proud to claim as a legacy.  \n\n"

        "description": "No, not Butters from South Park’s adorable superhero alter ego -- this Professor Chaos is a sativa-dominant hybrid with a complex taste and supercharged cerebral effects. The strain is a cross between two potent varieties in their own right: Jack Herer-descended Jack The Ripper and Mad Scientist, an indica that gave us Dr. Who. Professor Chaos provides smokers with the energy and creative thinking needed to accomplish anything from errands to more complicated work. Its THC content ranges from 20% to 25%.\n\nEven at a glance, Professor Chaos’ flowers are impressive enough to live up to their grandiose name. The tapered, medium-sized buds have a fluffy, sativa-like texture and the leaves tear away easily from the central stem. Leaves themselves are a light green, offset by pistils that range in color from yellow to deep orange. The chunky buds are dusted by icy trichomes, making this strain slightly sticky to the touch. When properly cured, the flowers smell strongly of tangy, sour citrus. Grinding or breaking open the buds gives off a more piney odor. Although Professor Chaos’ taste isn’t especially memorable, users may detect a spiciness when exhaling. This is a very pungent strain -- its funk can linger for a while after users have finished smoking.\n\nProfessor Chaos has a high that hits the smoker relatively quickly. Users may feel an increased pressure around the eyes and temples and a heightened sense of awareness. If not overly disoriented, they may then detect a change in thinking that can jump from one subject to the next in a freely associative way. If consumed in moderation, this cerebral strain can aid tasks that require problem-solving skills and creative thinking. Meanwhile, a slight body high confers relaxation and may mellow out any edge brought by the more cerebral effects. Professor Chaos has medical applications that mirror its recreational uses. Its soaring euphoric effects can temporarily improve move for those afflicted with stress and depression. If pointed in the right direction, its sense of focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to work on a single task. Overall, this strain’s boost of energy is an asset for anyone who suffers from constant lethargy, or just needs a pick me up before getting things done. Professor Chaos’ mild physical high can also be a somewhat effective analgesic that treats chronic aches and pains without weighing users down with couchlock. Because of this strain’s tendency to induce racing recursive thinking, it is not recommended for those prone to anxiety or paranoia. Its frenzied nature means that this is also not a strain for bedtime use, as it’s likely to keep smokers more wired than drowsy. Professor Chaos’ high is said to last longer than average, even for more experienced cannabis consumers.\n\nAt least two companies -- TGA Genetics and Homegrown Natural Wonders -- have seeds of Professor Chaos for commercial sale. Prospective growers may also be lucky enough to obtain clippings of this comparatively rare strain to grow as genetically identical “clones.” Professor Chaos can be cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor growing calls for semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. If grown indoors, this medium-height plant should be trained to fit into its grow space through the pruning and bending of branches early in the vegetative stage. Professor Chaos flowers within 8 to 9 weeks -- a relatively short period of time for a sativa. Growers should also be warned that this is a very pungent strain, during both vegetative and flowering stages. Those looking to keep their operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filter and exhaust fans.\n\nWith a rollicking high that stimulates thought but also entails physical relaxation, Professor Chaos is a great choice for a range of situations. Its energetic and alert nature works well in social situations, easing potential tension and driving conversation. It’s also appropriate for solo use, as it can push users to accomplish tasks they might otherwise find dull. If you do sample Professor Chaos, just don’t let it drive you to cover yourself in tinfoil and launch an ill-fated campaign of supervillainy like our old friend Butters.\n\n"

        "description": "Wedding Cake, sometimes known as Pink Cookies, is a strain that leans on some very popular genetics to yield a balanced high and a dynamic taste. It is a cross between sour hybrid Cherry Pie and the universally appealing Girl Scout Cookies. And although its flavor may vary depending on the phenotype, Wedding Cake doesn’t exactly taste like any traditional nuptial dessert most have ever tasted -- instead, its profile is mostly sour and tangy with just a hint of creaminess. Increasingly popular for its well-rounded effects, Wedding Cake has both recreational and medical applications. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has founded flowers of this strain to have between 16 and a staggering 25% THC.Wedding Cake is distinguished by its very large and colorful flowers. The chunky, globular nuggets adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure, with tightly curling leaves. The leaves themselves are an earthy green to brown. They are threaded through with orange hairs, which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. A high concentration of trichomes gives this strain its high THC levels as well as an incredibly sticky texture. Wedding Cake’s buds are as aromatically striking as they are visually impressive. When properly cured, they smell vegetal: damp and mossy with just a hint of citrus. Hanging out underneath is a skunky funk that betrays the influence of grandparent strain OG Kush, while breaking up or grinding the buds gives off notes of spicy sandalwood. When combusted, Wedding Cake may be harsh, stinging smokers’ sinuses or throats with its acrid smoke. It tastes sweet and rich on the exhale, with a super subtle creamy mouthfeel that some might compare to the taste of cake.me might compare to cake.This strain’s high starts relatively quickly, taking hold primarily in the head. Users may find their thoughts to be more fast-paced or intense, and may perceive their surroundings more acutely. In the right set and setting, this change in thinking is accompanied by feelings of giddiness or euphoria. Less than an hour into the high, Wedding Cake’s indica side kicks in. Smokers might feel increased warmth and a pleasant heaviness that spreads through the spine and limbs. Even in the midst of this sedation, though, cerebral stimulation continues, allowing users to feel uniquely “tuned in” to their surroundings. This holistic combination of mental and physical effects lends itself to complex activities like creating art, exercising, and even sex. As the high progresses, so does this strain’s body high -- after a few bowls, smokers may find themselves couchlocked.Wedding Cake may also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to bring about feelings of perceptiveness can aid those with mild to moderate stress, anxiety, and depression, helping them feel more “in the moment.” Because this strain leaves users lucid and levelheaded, it can also help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on specific tasks. Wedding Cake’s gradual waves of physical relaxation can soothe both temporary and chronic aches and pains and, in high enough doses, can bring about relief for insomnia. Finally, it can be a potent appetite stimulant for those who have lost their hunger to disease, medication, or chemotherapy.Whether it’s billed as Wedding Cake or Pink Cookies, seeds of this strain do not seem to be available for commercial sale. Prospective growers will need to obtain cuttings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It is said to be a temperamental plant, and not the best choice for novice growers. Detailed information on Wedding Cake’s cultivation is not readily available, but, like many hybrids, it can be grown in controlled indoor conditions or outdoors in warm, humid climates with average temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. We also know that parent strain Cherry Pie is particularly mold resistant, a characteristic that may carry over to some phenotypes of this strain. Wedding Cake offers growers a moderate yield for their efforts.While some married couples indulge in a piece of their frozen wedding cake on a first anniversary, a few tokes of Wedding Cake would be just as satisfying. Rich and relaxing, it can stoke emotion and passion -- and fortunately, it’s not such a knockout that it’ll prevent you from enjoying a little bit of intimacy.\n"

Grown outdoors in Washington state's sunny and fertile Okanogan Valley, it represents the best of what sativas have to offer. It has a complex flavor profile and a long-lasting cerebral high that can be potent even for more experienced cannabis users. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Dirty Girl to have between 17% and a whopping 28% THC.Dirty Girl's flowers are visually unremarkable, with small to medium buds that have both elongated and spherical shapes depending on the phenotype. The leaves are yellow-green and are threaded through with honey-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). One visual highlight, however, is the high concentration of sticky trichomes that coat the surfaces and inner crevices of these flowers. When properly cured, the flowers give off a hashy, incense like aroma, evidence of grandparent strain Afghani. A tropical citrus tang lurks underneath this musk, and when buds are ground or broken open, they may give off a faint sting of ammonia. When combusted, Dirty Girl yields a smooth smoke that tastes simultaneously sweet and lemony on the exhale.Dirty Girl has a high that takes hold quickly, making itself known with an initial headrush and a tingling pressure around the eyes and temples. As time progresses, smokers may notice a rapid increase in associative thinking, a pattern that sometimes leads to mindrace. This uptick in cerebral activity can be accompanied by glowing euphoria, making users feeling more chatty and friendly than they ordinarily might. These energized effects can provide all the motivation needed to plow through a long to-do list or to clean up around the house. Eventually, a slight body high creeps up to ground out any disorienting mindrace; this combination of mental stimulation and physical ease may facilitate deeply creative or analytical thinking. In the right conditions, Dirty Girl can also live up to her name by acting as a powerful aphrodisiac. Because its onset can cause smokers to feel more wired than relaxed, this strain may not be the best choice before bedtime.Dirty Girl's strong action on the brain makes it a good option for medical cannabis patients. Because it allows users to feel simultaneously focused and relaxed, it may improve concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. Those struggling with stress or depression may find that Dirty Girl's thoughtful mindset allows them to find fulfillment by living \"in the moment.\" The slight physical effects made ease mild to moderate aches and pains, but as noted, this may not be the best way to crush stubborn cases of insomnia. Because of its early tendency towards recursive thinking, Dirty Girl is not recommended for those who are prone to anxiety or paranoia.Seeds of Dirty Girl do not seem to be available for purchase online. Instead, prospective growers should obtain clippings from mature plants that can be grown as genetically identical \"clones.\" This strain can thrive when grown outdoors -- as its success in central Washington has shown -- but such cultivation requires warm and semi-humid temperatures with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. It can be conveniently grown indoors, as its plants are short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should regularly 'top' plants of Dirty Girl by trimming any broad fan leaves in order to let light and air reach low-growing flowering nodes. Dirty Girl flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers growers a typically high yield for their efforts. In order to preserve the precious trichomes on newly-harvested flowers, growers should be sure to properly cure their buds -- this is a two-stage process that involves first drying the flowers upside down in ambient conditions of 50% humidity and then sealing them in airtight jars in ambient conditions of 60-65% humidity.This fast and buzzy sativa is a great example of locally-conscious cannabis breeding. Its tasty citrus flavor and long-lasting high are valuable to cannabis veterans and novices alike. Dirty Girl can be a great way to boost daytime energy -- and might even come in handy as a caffeine alternative.\n"

        "description": "In addition to boasting world-class science and engineering facilities and educating alumni like Anna Faris and Joel McHale, The University of Washington has the distinction of lending its name to a popular strain of cannabis. UW, also known as U-Dub or UW Purple, is a strong indica that was allegedly swiped from one the university’s medical research facilities. It has since become a cult favorite, with a complex taste and strong sedative effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured UW’s THC content at between 14% and 20%.UW boasts large, eye-catching flowers that are spherical in shape. These buds have the dense, heavy structure that marks other pure indica varieties. The tightly-coiled leaves are almost equal parts green and vivid purple and are threaded through with copper-colored pistils. Any purple in the leaves is due to a high genetic concentration of anthocyanins -- pigments like chlorophyll that, when stimulated by cold weather in the growing process, bring out red and purple hues. Incidentally, purple is also one of The University of Washington’s school colors!. A thick coating of milky white trichomes covers the already-colorful flowers and gives them a very sticky, resinous texture. UW’s bag appeal doesn’t end at its visuals, though -- a fruity, berry-like tang jumps off of the strain’s flowers. Grinding or breaking open the buds yields a dank and earthy odor.  When combusted, UW gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and induce coughing; on the exhale, this smoke tastes like incense and musk, and is somewhat reminiscent of an Afghani landrace. Notably, this strain has no discernible grape flavors -- the same pigments that create its purple coloring do not have a corresponding effect on taste.UW has a slow, creeping high that may not take hold until several minutes after users have savored the strain’s rich taste. A heaviness fills the head and spreads down the limbs and trunk. Smokers are struck with a thorough feeling of relaxation, and may be more than happy to settle into the closest comfortable seating area. UW does not come with a particularly cerebral mindset. Instead, users may feel a distinct sense of contentment even as their thoughts remain hazy and dreamlike. As such, UW is a great choice for kicking back with a movie or some mellow music. It can also work well in social settings, provided that the user is surrounded by familiar friends and positive vibes. Better suited to bedtime enjoyment, this is not an ideal strain for the morning or afternoon ... unless users plan on sitting happily motionless for a while.UW’s sedative effects can also be very helpful to medical cannabis patients. Its total relaxation can temporarily blunt the acute symptoms associated with anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. It may also soothe aches and pains -- whether short-term and incidental or chronic as a result of conditions like arthritis or lupus. UW’s anti-inflammatory properties can take the edge off of headaches or upset stomachs. In large enough doses, it can also provide relief from insomnia, lulling users into a deep a restful sleep. Because of its lack of cerebral effects, UW comes with a relatively low risk of paranoia.Perhaps because of the mystery surrounding this strain’s origin and genetics, seeds are not commercially available; prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants to grow as identical “clones.” UW can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires warm, Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperature in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants are short and bushy, with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to “top” their plants by regularly trimming away large fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s full purple potential should also shock the plants by exposing them to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. UW flowers within a short 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.You don’t have to be a UW student to enjoy this strain’s prized effects. Toke on this bud’s rich, well-rounded flavor and let its waves of sedation wash over you. UW is a great example of what the Pacific Northwest’s ever-growing cannabis scene has to offer. \n"

        "description": "Emerald Jack is a sativa-leaning hybrid. It was created by Emerald Triangle Seeds, a breeding company named for Northern California’s notoriously fertile and cannabis-friendly Humboldt County. Enduring favorite Jack Herer lends this strain not only its name but also its strong herbal and citrus flavor profile. Emerald Jack’s other parent strain is the sleepy Emerald OG. With a refreshing flavor and a long-lasting, buzzy high, this is a go-to daytime sativa. Its THC content ranges from 15% to 20%.Emerald Jack’s flowers are small and round, with a shape reminiscent of popcorn. The buds adhere in a tight, dense structure more typical of indicas than sativas. True to the strain’s name, Emerald Jack’s leaves are a vibrant emerald green, with rust-colored pistils -- although a thick film of trichomes may lend some buds a dusty, muted color. This sticky strain may be difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Sampling Emerald Jack’s scent puts it bag appeal front and center. When properly cured, the terpene-rich flowers give off the woodsy aroma of pine and cedar. Some hints of sharp lemon zest are present as well. Breaking open or grinding up the buds shows off some of this strain’s funkier odors, evidence of its Kush lineage. When combusted, Emerald Jack gives off a smooth smoke that tastes simultaneously herbal and skunky on the exhale.Somewhat unusually for a sativa, Emerald Jack may take several minutes to show its full effects. Users will eventually detect a change in their patterns of thinking -- ideas may jump from one to the next in free association. Users may also feel that their thoughts or surroundings take on a new sense of intensity. These increased cerebral effects are often accompanied by feelings of emotional well-being and even euphoria. As such, Emerald Jack is a great strain to inspire work on creative projects. It can also provide the energy and motivation needed to take on a busy day’s tasks. The high comes with few discernible physical effects and will likely not trap users in a state of couchlock. Emerald Jack is the opposite of a bedtime strain, and may leave smokers feeling wired if they partake too late at night.Emerald Jack’s acute mental effects have some benefit for medical cannabis patients. Because it allows users to maintain a clear sense of focus, it can help those with attention deficit disorders. Its inspiring and mood-altering character can also help users dealing with mild to moderate stress or depression. Physically speaking, Emerald Jack can be a powerful appetite stimulant. It may also ease the severity of headaches and migraines. Because of its the initial “mindrace” and recursive that come with this strain’s high, it is not recommended for those prone to anxiety or paranoia.Seeds of Emerald Jack are available for purchase online. Alternatively, prospective growers can obtain small clippings from healthy, mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. Emerald Jack can be grown indoors or out. Its relatively lanky plants may thrive outdoors, but they require warm, semi-humid climates with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If nurturing this strain indoors, growers will want to bend or prune branches early on in order to train them to fit in limited growing spaces. Like many other sativas, Emerald Jack has a long flowering period of about 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Outdoors, it is ready for harvest in mid October. It offers growers a high yield for their efforts -- in fact, the branches may need to be supported by artificial means like wooden dowels in order to keep from drooping under the weight of a newly-flowered crop.Growers should also cure the harvested buds in order to preserve Emerald Jack’s taste and potency. This process involves first drying the buds by hanging them upside down for about a week in conditions of 50% humidity and about 70 degrees; and then sealing the dried buds in wide-mouthed jars in surroundings of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and between 60-65% humidity.Well-suited for use in the morning or early afternoon, Emerald Jack is a great strain to accompany both social and solo activities. Experienced cannabis users may functionally coast along on its uplifting, energetic high -- but newcomers should be aware of this sativa’s potent effects of the brain.\n"

        "description": "Cotton Candy Kush is a name used to describe two apparently distinct strains -- one is an indica-heavy hybrid from breeders Delicious Seeds; the other is an older, more mysterious hybrid that has circulated in Canada for decades.Delicious Seeds’ Cotton Candy Kush is a popular indica-leaning plant with memorable flavors and an enduring sedative high. It is a cross between the incredibly aromatic Lavender strain and Power Plant, which is derived from sativa landraces indigenous to South Africa. This strain’s THC content is purported to be 20%.This Cotton Candy Kush’s bag appeal is immediately apparent: it boasts large buds that hold long, tapered shapes. The buds have a textbook sativa structure, with loose, fluffy leaves that can torn easily from their central stems -- their texture is not unlike the wispy spun sugar of cotton candy itself. Leaves are forest green and are shot through with pollen-collecting pistils that begin as small white hairs that turn pink as plants mature. Shades of light and dark purple add even more color, and come about as the result of anthocyanin pigments in the plants’ genetics, activated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Crystalline trichomes give the flowers a very sticky texture, again underscoring the strain’s similarity to carnival-bought cotton candy. When cured, these flowers smell sweet and fruity, almost bordering on saccharine. Floral and citrus notes hang out underneath. This Cotton Candy Kush burns smooth and tastes of fruity, cloying bubble gum on the exhale.Delicious Seeds’’ Cotton Candy Kush takes hold quickly but gently, conferring a tingly relaxation behind the eyes and temples that spreads into a smile and moves down through the shoulders and core. Although this strain offers some lucid mental stimulation, these effects are soon accompanied by strong sedative effects,  making this a good choice for a mellow night in. Medically speaking, this Cotton Candy Kush can be effective in treating aches and pains, depressed or anxious moods, or stubborn cases of insomnia. It’s appropriate for use anywhere between late afternoon and just before bedtime.Delicious Seeds has released seeds of their Cotton Candy Kush variety for online sale. It can thrive indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires humid climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. This strain has a favorable bud to leaf ratio, meaning that growers may not need to be as vigilant when pruning broad, light-blocking fan leaves. It flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers.The second Cotton Candy Kush in wide circulation is a hybrid cross of landrace indica Afghani and perennial sativa favorite Haze. It was originally produced by the Vancouver Island-based Federation Seed Company and although it’s no longer actively bred, clones of the plant continue to change hands in the region. This variety’s THC content ranges from 17% to 22%.Federation’s Cotton Candy Kush is marked by medium-sized flowers that adhere in dense, indica-typical bud structures. They are extremely resinous, making them psychoactively potent and doubly valuable in the production of wax, shatter, and other THC concentrates. When properly cured, the flowers have the danky, hashy smell that you’d expect of an Afghani-derived crossbreed. When combusted, this Cotton Candy Kush can induce coughing and may cause sinuses to water with its harsh, acrid smoke. On the exhale, smoke tastes rich and aromatic.This Cotton Candy Kush has more balanced effects than Delicious Seeds’ version. It comes on quickly, elevating mood and stimulating cerebral activity. This thoughtfulness is soon accompanied by a creeping feeling of body melt that can help users move more slowly and breathe more easily without totally immobilizing them. This stain can also help medical cannabis patients by easing aches and pains -- whether incidental, due to injury or soreness, or chronic, due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. In large enough doses, this Cotton Candy Kush can relieve stubborn cases of insomnia. Negative side effects include a tendency to dry out sinuses and mucus membranes, leading to red eyes and dry mouth.As noted, this is a clone only strain - prospective growers must gain access to Pacific Northwest growers from whom they can take clippings from mature plants of Cotton Candy Kush in order to grow genetically identical clones. These plants can be successfully grown indoors or out; the wide variety of sativa landraces in this strain’s Haze background make it hardy and resistant to harsh growing conditions. Indoors, the short, bushy crops can easily fit in limited grow spaces. This hybrid Cotton Candy Kush flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a moderate yield for their efforts.\n"

        "description": "Although its name may be a shameless (and effective) appeal to stoner appetites, Blueberry Cheesecake comes through with distinctive flavors and a well-balanced high. It is a cross between fruity staple Blueberry and U.K. native Cheese. Notably, this genetic profile is identical to that of Big Buddha Seeds’ strain Blue Cheese; it is possible (albeit unclear, given this strain’s limited documentation) that Blueberry Cheesecake is in fact a distinct phenotype of Blue Cheese itself. As with Blue Cheese, Blueberry Cheesecake offers a tangy flavor profile and sativa-leaning effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s flowers to have between a modest 10% and a solid 20% THC.Blueberry Cheesecake has medium-sized flowers that range in shape from circular to spade-like when fully cured. The buds adhere in a dense indica structure and the tightly coiled leaves appear bright green with orange pistils. Certain phenotypes are streaked with varying shades of blue and purple. These latter colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold temperatures in the growing process; this colorful transformation is similar to the mechanism by which depleted chlorophyll levels cause foliage to change colors in autumn. Trichomes cover the buds, giving them a sticky texture and a moist sheen. The bright and fruity smell of blueberries -- so often associated with other strains descended from Blueberry bud -- is made more complex in this case by the presence of Skunk-derived Cheese in the plant’s genetics. Blueberry Cheesecake smells simultaneously fruity and sour, with a hint of citrus tang. Grinding or breaking up the buds intensifies the underlying funkiness. When burnt, this strain has a thick, lung-expanding smoke that tastes simultaneously like fruit and cheese on the exhale. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is a very pungent smoke and any users looking to keep their consumption on the down low should take reasonable precautions.Blueberry Cheesecake offers a slow, creeping high - it may take several minutes before smokers can pick up on its buzzy, head-focused effects. Once it settles in, this strain is marked by a substantial emotional uplift. Users may feel chatty, social, and more thoughtful. Blueberry Cheesecake can also sharpen the senses, making sights or sounds seem more intense. A sense of physical relaxation creeps up as the high peaks -- this body high may lend a psychedelic angle to users’ already-skewed perception, and can cause anything from visual distortions to time dilation. Because it affects both the brain and body, Blueberry Cheesecake is a good accompaniment for activities that involve holistic functioning like yoga or dancing. It can even be a potent aphrodisiac. Couchlock is not commonly reported after moderate doses, but users can become incapacitated if they indulge in more than a few bowls.This strain’s far-reaching effects also have great value for medical cannabis patients. Blueberry Cheesecake can ease aches and pains, whether mild or long-term and acute. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also settle upset stomachs. As noted, in large enough doses, this strain can be an effective treatment for insomnia. Psychological benefits include temporary relief from the harsh symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. Blueberry Cheesecake’s sense of sustained focus can also be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders. Because it is so versatile, this strain is appropriate for both daytime and nighttime use.Several seed companies have made seeds of Blue Cheesecake available for sale online. It is a relatively easy and forgiving crop for novice growers. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite this strain’s balanced genetics, its plants have a characteristically indica shape, with bushy lateral branches and heights rarely exceeding 3 feet. Growers should “top” their plants by trimming away any light-blocking fan leaves to encourage growth of the flowering nodes on lower branches. Those looking to bring out Blueberry Cheesecake’s eye-catching purple hues should also expose their plants to cold nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blueberry Cheesecake flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts. As much as it is a pungent strain when smoked, it can also reek as it’s growing -- growers  should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans if they want to keep their operations discreet.A distinctive addition to the Blueberry family, Blueberry Cheesecake’s strange blend of flavors may be an acquired taste for some. That said, its versatility makes it appropriate for any number of situations -- from energetic socializing to introspective solo enjoyment.\n"

        "description": "Although strains in the Kush family are typically more sleepy and stoney, hybrid Blue Kush is a sativa-dominant strain with an energetic kick. It is a cross between fruity staple Blueberry and indica building block OG Kush and has inherited all the potency and flavor of these parent strains. Blue Kush was created by Spanish seed bank Dinafem, the company responsible for varieties like Moby Dick and Amnesia Kush. Dinafem says Blue Kush has a THC content of 20%; Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found its flowers to have THC levels between 13% and 18%.Blue Kush has small, clustered flowers that take a popcorn-like shape once cured. The round buds have a dense, heavy bud structure often associated with indica varieties. Mossy green leaves are threaded through with yellowish pistils. Some phenotypes of this strain have hints of light to deep purple, the result of pigments passed on from parent strain Blueberry; when exposed to colder than average temperatures in the growing process, these pigments generate vibrant blue and purple hues. The already-colorful flowers are dusted with clear to white trichomes that give the flowers a very sticky texture. Blue Kush gives off the unmistakable aroma of blueberries; the scent is sweet without any hint of tartness or skunk. Grinding or breaking up the buds yields a woodsy, piney scent, evidence of the OG Kush in this strain’s genetics. When burnt, Blue Kush gives off very smooth smoke that tastes sweet and vaguely musky on the exhale.The high from Blue Kush takes hold quickly, gives smokers an initial headrush. Some changes in the perception of sights and sounds may be temporarily disorienting. Users may also be struck by an increase in freely associative thoughts, sometimes manifesting as stream-of-consciousness chattiness. The overall feeling conferred by this strain is upbeat and energetic, and can be pushed to accommodate the user’s priorities: it can be great accompaniment for tasks involving problem solving or creative thinking, or can provide the boost of energy needed for everyday tasks like housecleaning. While Blue Kush comes with some slight physical relaxation, its sativa effects ultimately eclipse any weighty feelings of couchlock.Blue Kush has application for medical cannabis patients as well. Its euphoric uplift can provide some benefits for those struggling with stress, anxiety, and depression. Its strong cerebral nature may also aid focus for patients with attention deficit disorders. Physically, this strain’s indica side can relieve mild to moderate aches and muscle pains. It can also have anti-inflammatory properties, useful in treating seizure conditions and multiple sclerosis. Because of its powerful mental stimulation, Blue Kush is well-suited to morning or afternoon use and may not be the best strain to savor before bed.Dinafem has made seeds of Blue Kush available for sale online; alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain’s solid, time-tested genetics ensure hardy, disease-resistant, and novice-friendly plants that can be successfully cultivated outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. The medium-height plants can also be grown indoors, where growers will need to trim and prune branches in order to train the bushes to fit in indoor grow spaces. Those looking to bring out Blue Kush’s full visual potential should consider “shocking” the plants by exposing the plants to cold nighttime temperatures just before the flowering stage. Blue Kush flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It can yield up to 46 grams (1.6 ounces) per square foot when grown indoors and up to a whopping 74 grams (about 2.5 ounces) per individual plant when grown outdoors. Curing Blue Kush’s buds -- by first hanging them upside down to dry and then sealing them in airtight containers surrounded by moderate humidity -- will help preserve their unique flavor and valuable trichomes.With genetics that closely resemble those of recent novelty strain Blue Ivy, Blue Kush is part of an emerging class of varieties that build on the fruity and potent qualities of Blueberry. Blue Kush’s buzzy high works well in social settings -- especially at parties, where its rich aroma is sure to turn a few heads.\n"

        "description": "Aspen OG is an up and coming hybrid with balanced indica and sativa effects. This strain is a cross between the Sour Diesel-descended Sour Cream and popular regional hybrid San Fernando Valley OG Kush. Developed by 303 Seeds -- a seasoned group of Colorado-based breeders named for DenverÔÇÖs three digit area code -- Aspen OG has a lip-smacking kushy taste and an easygoing, balanced high. ItÔÇÖs a great option for social or solo enjoyment, whether youÔÇÖre high in the Rockies or just kicking back at home.Aspen OG has medium-sized flowers that show off a combination of indica and sativa traits: the buds have the durable and densely-packed structure typical of indica varieties while they hold an elongated spade-like shape characteristic of sativas. The twisted, coiled leaves are a yellowish-green and are threaded through with orange hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants). This strainÔÇÖs blanket of white trichomes may remind you of a fresh coat of powder on AspenÔÇÖs storied slopes; this resin accounts for the strainÔÇÖs potency and gives the flowers a sticky texture and a silvery tint. As you might expect for a strain named for one of countryÔÇÖs most densely-forested regions, Aspen OG has a scent that is at once dank and piney. The mossy scent of wood and earth is undercut by a funky, sour kick, courtesy of the Sour Diesel in this strainÔÇÖs lineage. Breaking or grinding up the buds yields a nutty, toasty aroma. When combusted, Aspen OGÔÇÖs smoke is smooth and tastes skunky and a little bit sweet on the exhale.The high from Aspen OG comes in waves. It begins as a fast-acting head high, causing users to feel a distinct pressure around the eyes and temples. Stimulated cerebral activity follows soon after, sharpening senses and making thoughts race. Smokers may detect a psychedelic edge to this altered perception -- phenomena like visual distortions and a powerful sense of time dilation are common. These initially energetic effects can be great for accomplishing tasks from the mundane to the creative. After a while, a heavy body stone creeps in, releasing physical tension and slowing down any overstimulated thinking. While users may feel very relaxed and happy to remain in one place, they wonÔÇÖt necessarily be couchlocked. Although it can be consumed at almost any time of day, Aspen OG is not recommended for use just before bedtime, as its sativa edge may keep users alert and awake. This may not be the most powerful choice for cannabis veterans with a high tolerance for THC, but it can be just the thing for newcomers or casual smokers.Just as it confers a blend of mental and physical effects for recreational users, Aspen OG can have application for medical cannabis patients as well. Its physical sedation can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether theyÔÇÖre incidental or injury-related or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia. Its anti-inflammatory properties can be good for anything from headaches to upset stomachs. It can also be a strong appetite stimulant. Psychologically speaking, Aspen OGÔÇÖs cerebral intensity and emotional uplift can provide temporary relief for those struggling with mild to moderate stress, anxiety, and depression. Its lucid sense of focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders.Although 303 has released seeds of Aspen OG, they are only sold in brick-and-mortar locations in order to avoid online retail fraud. If youÔÇÖre not lucky enough to live in Colorado to pick some seeds up in person, you may be able to obtain clippings from mature, healthy Aspen OG plants in order to take clippings that can be grown as ÔÇ£clones.ÔÇØ This strain is considered a moderately difficult grown and may not be the best choice for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or outdoor, although successful outdoor growing requires a warm, humid climate and consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. Aspen OG flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.A relatively rare find east of the Rockies, Aspen OG is a balanced and boldly-flavored strain that makes a great addition to the OG Kush family. And while we canÔÇÖt exactly recommend blazing before hitting the slopes, Aspen OG can be the perfect way to kick off a protracted and relaxing apr?¿s-ski session.\n"

        "description": "Blue Ivy is an indica-dominant hybrid found primarily in the U.S. West Coast market. Also known as OG Blue Ivy, it is said to be a cross between the omnipresent Blue Dream and none other than heavy hitter OG Kush. Although this strain’s creation is largely undocumented, its name comes from exactly where you’d think -- it started popping up in Los Angeles area dispensaries in 2012, shortly after Beyonce and Jay-Z announced the birth of their daughter Blue Ivy. This strain confers heavy sedative effects that make it appealing to recreational and medical users alike. Blue Ivy’s THC content has been reported at between 15% and 20%.Blue Ivy has smaller buds that when dried appear more spherical than long and tapered. The buds hold together in a dense indica structure with the small leaves tightly curled in towards their central stem. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green, offset by brown to rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Plentiful trichomes give the flowers a silvery-white sheen and an incredibly sticky texture. The smell of blueberries, passed on from Blueberry via parent strain Blue Dream, predominates. A skunky, chemical-inflected odor -- likely the influence of OG Kush -- gives the blueberry aroma a more tart and funky quality. When combusted, Blue Ivy’s flowers give off a harsh smoke that may sting the sinuses and cause users to cough. When exhaled, this strain leaves a lingering fruity taste, mixed with the rich flavor of hash. This can be a very pungent smoke and those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.Blue Ivy hits quickly for a mostly indica strain. Users may feel a sudden tingling pressure in the face, particularly around the eyes and temples. This sensation soon blooms throughout the rest of the body, granting relaxation in the limbs and core. Smokers may find themselves able to move more slowly or breathe more deeply. Any mental effects manifest more as emotional uplift than as cerebral intensity -- feelings of euphoria or giddiness are commonly reported, but an uptick in analytical thinking is rare As the high progresses, users may find their hazy contentment melting into couchlock or powerful sleepiness. Blue Ivy may lend itself to quiet, introspective activities like enjoying slow, psychedelic films or music. Because of its tendency towards laziness, Blue Ivy may not be a great strain to enjoy in the morning or early afternoon.These sedative indica properties make Blue Ivy an effective treatment for many medical cannabis users as well. Moderate to severe aches and pains may be dulled by the force of this strain’s holistic relaxation. It can also serve as a particularly strong appetite stimulant for those who have lost the desire to eat as the result of medication or chemotherapy. The same tingly sensation felt at the onset of this strain’s high can valuable to glaucoma patients, as it can decrease painful intraocular pressure. Blue Ivy can be a strong antidote to insomnia, even in moderate doses. Its general sense of well-being can even provide psychological benefits for those suffering from anxiety, depression, or PTSD. Blue Ivy is said to be potent and long-lasting, even for those with a high tolerance for THC.With little information on Blue Ivy’s genetics -- the now-defunct California dispensary 661 Medical has so far been its only documented distributor -- we have limited information on best practices for cultivating the strain. Seeds are not commercially available, meaning that prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of Blue Ivy in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain’s indica-leaning genetics would take well to indoor grow operations, as plants likely grow short and bushy with wide lateral branching. “Topping” the plants by trimming off broad fan leaves will help light and air stimulate the growth of flowering buds on lower branches. Blue Ivy’s parent strains flower within 9 to 10 weeks. Growers may expect moderate to high yields from their crops -- OG Kush typically yields 45 grams/1.6 ounces and Blue Dream 56 grams/2 ounces of flower per square foot of plant. Because it’s a pungent smoke, Blue Ivy may also be a pungent grow, and users should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters if they want to keep their indoor operations a secret.Although it sprang to life on the West Coast, Blue Ivy’s stellar genetics and dynamic taste have the potential to flourish nationwide. Well-suited to solo use or intimate social gatherings, it’s just the thing to end a long and stressful day.\n"

        "description": "Sometimes the most successful crossbred strains are ones that build on the popularity and success of their parents. Balanced hybrid Blue Haze is an excellent example -- it’s the product of fruity favorite Blueberry and sativa hybrid Amnesia Haze. Blue Haze offers a wonderfully rich, fruity flavor and a potent, long-lasting high to boot. Cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 has found flowers of Blue Haze to have a THC content of between 16% and a whopping 26%.Blue Haze has medium to large flowers that hold an elongated, spade-like shape. The yellowish-green  leaves stick together in the dense, sticky bud structure so characteristic of indica varieties. Some phenotypes of this strain also boast bold shades of blue and purple in their flowers; these vibrant hues appear when high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments (inherited from parent strain Blueberry) are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Dewy, translucent trichomes coat the colorful flowers inside and out, making Blue Haze difficult to break up for pipes or joints without the use of a grinder. The unmistakable scent of blueberries jumps off of the cured buds, cloyingly sweet without any tart or skunky notes. Also present is a musky, herbal profile that may be familiar to fans of Haze. When combusted, Blue Haze gives off smoke that is thick and lung-expanding but smooth and unlikely to trigger a coughing fit. It tastes fruity and slightly spicy on the exhale, making it potentially appealing to smokers with a distaste for the dank, Kushy flavors of many other strains.Blue Haze delivers a quick headrush, manifesting as some initial dizziness or disorientation. Smokers may detect a full relaxation of their facial muscles -- and may not be able to resist a slow, creeping smile. The sativa in this strain’s lineage makes itself known upfront, with frenetic mental stimulation. Users may find themselves jumping gleefully from one thought to another. In social settings, such cerebral effects can stoke absorbing conversation among friends or strangers. As the high wears on, users inevitably feel a weightiness spread throughout the body. But while a newly heavy head and limbs may provoke the desire to lounge on the nearest couch, users will still feel functional enough to process their surroundings. Blue Haze’s balance between mental acuity and physical relaxation makes it an ideal choice for menial tasks like cleaning or running errands, as well as more intense, creative work like writing or drawing. It can also be great for unwinding with a movie and a nightcap after a long day.Blue Haze’s far-reaching effects can also be of value to medical cannabis patients. Its mellow sensation of being present or “in the moment” can be an affirming treatment for those suffering from slight to moderate stress, anxiety, or depression. Because it allows users to be simultaneously lucid and relaxed, it can also aid focus for patients with attention deficit disorders. Blue Haze’s somatic relaxation may soothe chronic aches and pains that come about from conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. In large enough doses, it can also function as a sleep aid, banishing trenchant insomnia. Blue Haze is appropriate for daytime through early evening use; because it can make users especially thoughtful, those enjoying it at night may want to moderate their consumption.Several companies have made seeds of Blue Haze available for sale online. Despite strong landrace roots -- grandparent strain Haze is descended from sativas indigenous to Thailand, India, Mexico, and South America -- it can be a finicky, sensitive strain and may not be the best choice for novice growers. It plants are short and bushy, typical of indicas, and can easily be grown indoors. Blue Haze has a favorable bud-to-leaf ratio, meaning that growers may not need to trim away fan leaves as often as they might with some other strains. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s full visual potential should also shock the plants with occasional cold nighttime temperatures in order to stimulate the aforementioned anthocyanin pigments and bring about shades of blue and purple in the leaves. Blue Haze flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a moderate yield of about 32 grams (or just over 1 ounce) of flower per square foot of plant.Fans of Blue Dream will be won over by Blue Haze -- the two have a very similar genetic profile. Potent and versatile, Blue Haze can be enjoyed in many different contexts. Its fruity, agreeable flavor may be especially welcome as a treat to be shared at parties.\n"

        "description": "Today’s legal cannabis market is constantly evolving, bit by bit taking on the quirks of similar consumer goods industries. It was maybe only a matter of time before weed -- once maligned as a dangerous substance used only by the lower classes -- became a luxury product. Isla OG is one such conspicuously expensive new strain, brought to us by L.A. Island, Inc.Isla OG made a splash after it was featured in rapper 2 Chainz’s web series Most Expensivest Shit (he smokes the stuff out in a joint rolled with 24-karat gold papers). It sells for $100 an eighth, which is more than three times as expensive as a similar quantity of cannabis at your average dispensary. This price tag nets you some novel packaging: once it’s trimmed, Isla OG apparently goes straight into aluminum canisters to cure; those canisters are then sold directly to the consumer. A few notches above plastic bags or pill bottles, this storage method has the advantage of freshness and a bit of supply chain transparency. That said, we’re a little skeptical about the producers’ choice of aluminum for Isla OG’s packaging -- as we’ve pointed out in our guide to weed storage, cannabis is best preserved in cool conditions. Metallic substances like aluminum can conduct heat, especially during shipment.There is very little information available about Isla OG’s genetic makeup. Producers LA Island (and their associated company Top Shelf THC) are no help; in fact, the manufacturer has no web presence whatsoever and no apparent products other than Isla’s sister strain Isla Hybrid and something called “Original OG.” The strain’s packaging doesn’t offer any clues either, simply stating that Isla is high quality and “air sealed.” The OG in the strain’s name seem to imply descent from classic indica OG Kush -- although “OG” is tossed around in cannabis marketing fairly often, and isn’t a definitive assurance of plant genetics. There are also rumors floating around digital cannabis forums that Isla OG has some Hawaiian landrace roots. Ultimately, we won’t be able to solve this mystery without a deep analysis of the strain’s terpene profile or some sort of documentation from its point or origin.Buds of Isla OG are medium sized and a have a tapered, spade-like shape. The flowers appear more wispy than densely-packed, suggesting a sativa background; the leaves stick straight out in pointy segments, reminiscent of cannabis’ cousin plant hops, instead of coiling tightly as they do in indica varieties. The flowers are a bright shade of spring green and have relatively few hairy pistils. Presumably because Isla OG is so well-preserved, packaged at its source, its trichomes are plentiful and give the strain a dewy appearance and a sticky texture. Its aroma has a musky character, not dissimilar to that of OG Kush; some notes of skunk and citrus are present as well.While Isla OG’s name and musky odor imply some indica genes, the uniquely wispy appearance of its buds hints at a dash of sativa as well. The few reviews available for Isla OG don’t dwell much on this expensive strain’s high. If you’ve been lucky enough to get your hands on an eighth, leave a review and let us know what you think.Some bad news for prospective growers: there are no seeds of Isla OG available for sale and, with such closely-guarded stock, it’s unlikely that many clones of Isla OG plants are circulating.A legitimately luxurious and rewarding strain? Or a hyped-up novelty, aimed at cannabis newcomers? For now, at least, the jury is out on Isla OG.\n"

        "description": "Boss Hogg (or Boss Hog) is the indica-dominant creation of The Cali Collective, a multiple Cannabis Cup-winning group of breeders active throughout California. Boss Hogg’s parents are two strains that are named for the year of their vintage: sativa Chemdawg 91 and the legendary clone-only indica Pre-98 Bubba Kush. Boss Hogg offers smokers a complex flavor profile and a versatile, evenhanded high. Testing laboratory Analytical 360 has measured Boss Hogg’s potency at between 17% - 20% THC.Boss Hogg has visually striking flowers, marked by a spade-like shape that is more long and tapered than spherical. The leaves, which have a distinctively raggy and loose texture, appear yellowish green with a few hairy brown pistils. The flowers are dusted with trichomes that give the pale flowers a silvery sheen. A dank and hashy aroma wafts up from the cured buds, and is not unlike incense. Hints of lemon can also be detected underneath the funk, while breaking up or grinding the buds gives off a more spicy scent. When burnt, Boss Hogg has a harsh, stinging smoke that may cause coughing or watery eyes in smokers. On the exhale, it hangs on the palate with herbal, piney flavors.The high from this strain starts off with a slow burn of relaxation. Smokers feel a gradually mounting heaviness in their limbs and core which, while it may not pin them down, may make them move more slowly. Deep breathing make come more easily and tense muscles may feel relaxed. Because their bodies are so sedated, smokers may take a while to notice that their thoughts and senses soon feel more amplified. These psychedelic vibes can be enjoyed in endless contexts. This strain is great for unwinding alone at home and because it won’t immobilize users, it’s great for either mundane tasks like cleaning or more pleasure pursuits like taking a long walk. Best enjoyed during the daytime or early evening, Boss Hogg may come with some couchlock as dosage is increased. The high is considered to be long-lasting, even for more experienced users.Boss Hogg has medical applications to match its wide-ranging recreational uses. Its strong sense of emotional well-being and general holistic relaxation can be good patients struggling with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The strain’s sense of clearheaded focus might also aid those with attention deficit disorders. Its slight sedative effects can moderate aches and pains, whether incidental, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia. Boss Hogg’s anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe headaches or upset stomachs. Because of this strain’s well-executed balance, it comes with less of a risk of the tiring “comedown” that can accompany an extended indica couch potato session.Boss Hogg can be grown from commercially-available seeds or, if growers are lucky enough to obtain them, clippings that can be grown as clones. It can be successfully grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation depends on a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. It can easily be accommodated indoors - plants reach a medium height, with bushy, laterally spreading branches. Growers should be sure to “top” their plants by trimming away any broad fan leaves that could block light or air reaching the low-growing flowering nodes. Boss Hogg flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. It offers growers a high yield of flowers in return for their efforts. In order to preserve their harvest’s potency and unique taste, growers should also cure their buds. Curing is a two-step process: first, users should hang flowers upside down for a week in conditions of 50% humidity and 70 degrees; they should then seal the dried flowers in airtight jars in conditions of 60% humidity and 70 degrees, checking regularly for mold.Despite a dank, funky odor that proves to be divisive for some users, Boss Hogg offers the best of what a well-balanced hybrid has to offer. Its trippy, sociable vibe can be a hit at parties; it can also be enjoyable in provoking some productive introspection.\n"

        "description": "In Ancient Greek myth, the oracles were religious figures who were thought to provide people with direct counsel and prophecy from the gods. Too bad there are no oracles around today to give us the real story behind the mysterious strain Oracle.As far back as 2009, word began circulating in digital cannabis forums about a super-potent strain called Oracle. Oracle reportedly carried unprecedented levels of THC and its plants flowered in record time. Because of these prized qualities, the strain’s value was set sky-high: seeds retailed for $200 each, while each clone sold for an eye-popping $1000.If you think that plain old bud with 45% THC seems too good to be true -- congratulations, your skepticism is well-founded. In 2013, cannabis testing laboratory The Werc Shop discovered that the terpenes (the chemical compounds that determine each strain’s smell, taste, and possibly high) in Oracle were identical to those in the well-known strain ACDC. It seemed that some sellers, thriving in the still-unregulated and largely illegal cannabis of the last few decades, re-packaged ACDC with fantastical claims and a mystical new name.Here’s the good news, though: while “Oracle” may not be the hyper-psychoactive flower that was promised, it does come with a big dose of CBD, the cannabinoid that relieves physical pain and inflammation. ACDC/Oracle is a cross between Resin Seeds’ Cannatonic and an unnamed, low-THC variety of cannabis ruderalis. Although it contains less than 1% THC, testing lab Analytical 360 has detected CBD levels between 8% and 14% (for reference, most strains contain less than 1% CBD).ACDC/Oracle is marked by small to medium-sized buds. The flowers are tight and densely-packed but the texture of the leaves is surprisingly fluffy. Leaves appear spring green and are threaded through with orange hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from flowering male plants). Fans of stickier strains may be disappointed by this flower’s lack of resin -- few if any trichomes dot the surfaces and interiors of the buds, accounting for their low THC levels. ACDC/Oracle smells simultaneously funky and sweet -- users may detect notes of berry and citrus alongside a pungent skunkiness. When combusted in a joint or a pipe, this strain burns smoothly and has a faint taste lemon on the exhale.Recreational users may want to give this strain a pass; with negligible amounts of THC, ACDC/Oracle is unlikely to bring about any psychoactive effects at all. Instead, it is of great value to medical cannabis patients -- especially those (like children) who want to avoid getting high.  CBD is thought to work on the endocannabinoid system mitigate or stop seizures, making this strain a possible treatment for those with conditions like epilepsy and Dravet’s Syndrome. It can also provide relief from aches and pains, whether short-term or chronic, as in cases of  lupus and fibromyalgia. Anti-inflammatory properties also make this flower good for mild to severe headaches, nausea, and digestive conditions. Because its use is primarily medical, ACDC/Oracle is frequently available in preparations like pills or tinctures.Some companies sell seeds of what they purport to be pure Oracle, carrying 45% THC, flowering within 4 weeks, and yielding as much as 4 ounces of flower per square foot. However, the aforementioned genetic testing by Werc Shop puts those claims very much in doubt. Growers with more realistic expectations should obtain seeds or clones of ACDC from reputable dealers or growers. ACDC/Oracle can be cultivated indoors or out, but growing outdoor requires as warm and semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. It can be a temperamental grow, requiring regular tending and mineral supplements, and it is not recommended for novice growers. ACDC flowers within 9 to 10 weeks, although it may take longer if grown outdoors in colder environments. As it flowers, growers may want to give this strain’s branches some extra support to prevent them from drooping under the weight of the new buds -- wooden dowels work well in this regard. Growers can expect an average yield from Oracle/ACDC.Although it’s not a miraculous, high-flying, high-yielding cure-all, Oracle/ACDC is undoubtedly valuable to many medical cannabis users. With a memorable smell and taste to boot, this strain provides relaxation and pain relief for those who don’t want to get high.\n"

        "description": "Despite its intimidating name, Big Wreck is an indica-dominant hybrid that’s more likely to leave you rested than wrecked. This strain is a cross between high-yielding indica Big Bud and intense sativa Trainwreck. These two come together to give Big Wreck a memorable aroma and a balanced, easygoing high. A high volume of trichomes gives this strain eye-catching bag appeal and accounts for its sky-high psychoactivity -- cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Big Wreck’s THC content at between 17% and 20% with a highest testing of nearly 27%.Parent strain is Big Bud named for its unusually large flowers and luckily, Big Wreck also impresses on this front. The buds are medium to large with a dense, heavy bud structure. The tightly-coiled leaves appear light green -- although this effect may in fact come from the strain’s high production of cloudy trichomes. These resin glands makes the flowers appear almost white from a distance and gives them a very sticky texture; this strain can be very difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Both parent strains have Afghani landrace indica in their lineage and it shows in Big Bud’s bold smell -- when cured, the flowers are powerfully skunky and earthy, while breaking these dense nuggets open yields a peppery hint of spice. Despite these acrid scents, though, Big Wreck gives off a smooth smoke that’s relatively easy on the lungs. On the exhale, this strain has a lingering sour taste that some might find unpleasant. Any smokers trying to keep their consumption discreet should be cautious of Big Wreck’s pungency.Big Wreck’s high mounts slowly, starting in the head. Many minutes after they’ve finished savoring bowl, smokers may feel that external stimuli like lights or sounds seem more intense. They may also find that their thinking has taken on a new, undefinable dimension. These somewhat psychedelic effects can provide the perfect backdrop for watching a trippy movie or listening to some moody music. A feeling of increased well-being is also common, and users might find themselves in the mood to socialize and share their good vibes. As the high wears on, heavy physical relaxation sets in: users may find that they can breathe more deeply and easily or that they are free of muscular tension. Although this semi-sedation can be great for vegging out at home, in isn’t as likely to induce couchlock as some stronger, purer indicas. Big Wreck can be a great way to stimulate conversation, to enhance a hike in nature, or simply to unwind at the end of the day. This high tends to last longer than average, even for more experienced cannabis users.Big Wreck’s versatile effects are also of value to medical cannabis patients. The strain’s relaxing properties may soothe deep-seated aches and pains. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can relieve painful symptoms like nausea or headaches. It can serve a strong appetite stimulant as well, helping patients who may have lost their appetites to cancer treatment or other medications or conditions. Psychologically speaking, Big Wreck’s mellow, creative character can be helpful in temporarily dulling the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Because its sativa effects are tempered by its sleepy indica side, Big Wreck comes with a relatively lower risk of paranoia; conversely, this strain’s sativa energy stops its indica body stone from weighing smokers down with couchlock or an eventual comedown.Breeders do not seem to have made seeds of Big Wreck available for sale online; instead, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of this strain in order to grow healthy, genetically identical “clones.” Big Wreck can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a warm, semi-humid climate with consistent direct daylight. Those growing this strain indoors should train plants to fit limited spaces early on in the vegetative stage by pruning stems and branches; unchecked, Big Wreck can stretch to almost 5 feet tall. This strain flowers within a short 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors.With an impressive genetic backbone, Big Wreck offers hybrid fans the best of both worlds -- cerebral stimulation and engagement with the outside world alongside a deep relaxation of both mind and body. Its high resin content also makes this strain valuable in the production of THC concentrates like hash and shatter.\n"

        "description": "Despite having some mysterious genetics, Bay 11 is a sativa that packs quite a punch. Created by experienced medical cannabis breeder Ken Estes (who also originated Grandaddy Purple), Bay 11 may be descended from the skunky hybrid Appalachia. Whatever its parentage, Bay 11 has won recognition for its balanced effects and distinctive, funky taste: it took first prize in the Sativa category of the 2011 San Francisco High Times Cannabis Cup. Genetic testing services also give Bay 11 high marks -- laboratory Analytical 360 has found its flowers to have between 15% and a whopping 25% THC.Bay 11 has small to medium-sized flowers that cling together in small, pebble-like clusters. Despite appearing dense and solid, the leaves actually have a fluffy texture and a wispy, feathery appearance when viewed at close range. The leaves themselves appear mossy green and have relatively few hairy pistils. Flowers of Bay 11 are coated in trichomes that appear more transparent than white; so while the buds are very sticky, they don’t have the silvery sheen of other highly resinous strains like White Widow. When properly cured, the flowers are very pungent, with such a strong dank and skunky odor that your stash may need to be double-bagged. When ground or broken open, this strain smells slightly spicy -- giving some credence to the theory that its other parent is OG Kush. Bay 11 gives off a smooth smoke when burnt in a joint or a pipe and has a pop of citrus flavor that jumps out on the exhale.Bay 11’s effects take hold quickly, with an initial tingle in facial and neck muscles. Users may notice themselves becoming more chatty if surrounded by friends; at the very least, they’ll become more observant, thinking more deeply and deliberately about otherwise things that might otherwise go unnoticed. Such cerebral effects are matched with an uptick in mood. Smokers report feeling anywhere from de-stressed to fully euphoric. As the high progresses, a warm calm melts through the core and lower body, conferring noticeable (but not overpowering) physical relaxation. This ideal balance between mind and body may allow users to open their minds to creative or analytical thinking. It can also be great for tasks that involve both mental acuity and physical coordination, like video games, exercise, and even sex. Be warned, though -- as consumption of Bay 11 increases, so does the likelihood of couchlock.Just as it has a wide range of recreational effects, Bay 11 also has various applications for medical cannabis patients. Because it enhances perception while still allowing users to feel at ease, it may help those with anxiety or depression to appreciate their surroundings and to live “in the moment.” That same sense of sustained focus can help patients with attention deficit disorders to work more efficiently. Bay 11’s indica sedation can relieve mild to moderate aches and pains, whether incidental or chronic and disease-related. It can also be a powerful appetite stimulant. Best enjoyed during the daytime, this strain may not be the best choice for anyone struggling with serious anxiety, as its initial feelings of “mindrace” may lead to paranoia.Estes has made seeds of Bay 11 available for sale online. Growers can also obtain cutting from mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. Bay 11 can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors, although outdoor grow operations requires semi-humid temperatures with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Grown indoors, plants show off their sativa heritage and may reach between 3 and 4 feet tall -- growers are encouraged to train these plants to fit in smaller spaces by trimming and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage. Bay 11 has a long flowering time, as is characteristic of purer sativa varieties: it is ready within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and can be harvested in late October when grown outdoors. This strain also rewards growers with a very high yield. Plants may offers as much as 83 to 102 grams (or 3 to 3.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant when grown indoors. This is also known to be a particularly pungent grow -- those looking to keep their operations on the D.L. should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.A great choice for waking-and-baking, Bay 11 represents the best of what balanced hybrids have to offer. So far, it’s also proven useful in crossbreeding -- Bay 11 was crossed with Blackberry Kush and then Romulan to produce the rare White Buffalo.\n"

        "description": "In many indigenous cultures of the Great Plains region, a white buffalo is so rare that it’s considered an important spiritual symbol. The potent White Buffalo strain is also prized for its rarity. This sativa-leaning hybrid is the product of pure indica Romulan and an unnamed cross between Blackberry Kush and Bay 11. It provides energetic and stimulating cerebral effects and has appeal for cannabis novices and veterans alike. Depending on the individual plant’s phenotype, White Buffalo may have as much as 25% THC.For the most part, this strain is visually unremarkable -- flowers are typically small and cluster together in popcorn-like nuggets. The buds have the dense, solid structure typical of indica varieties, with leaves tightly coiled around their central stem. The leaves are various shades of dark green, with relatively few pollen-catching orange pistils. One way White Buffalo’s flowers stand out, though, is their high resin production -- like the similarly-named White Widow, White Buffalo is coated in a layer of white trichomes that give it a soft, pale sheen. This resin also gives the flowers a very sticky texture that make the strain very difficult to break up by hand. When properly cured, the buds smell musky and sour, with some traces of berry aroma passed on from the Blackberry Kush grandparent strain. Breaking open or grinding the buds yields a woodsy scent of pine. When combusted, this strain gives off a harsh smoke that may induce coughing and irritate smoker’s sinuses. On the exhale, smoke tastes distinctly earthy and herbal.White Buffalo hits users with a quick headrush: they may feel increased circulation in the face, particularly around the eyes and temples. Some may also detect a slight dizziness. As they acclimate to the high, users will notice that their perception is sharper. Ordinary stimuli or thoughts may take on new significance, leading users into a cerebral and freely-associative sort of “mindrace.” In a comfortable set and setting, this stimulated thinking can be accompanied by surges of positive euphoric energy. Although some users report increased physical relaxation as their high wears on, White Buffalo is unlikely to immobilize you with couchlock. This strain’s energy and lucidity makes it a great accompaniment to mundane daily tasks like cleaning. It can also be extremely chatty and social, giving you a good excuse to stay up all night with friends. Potent for even those with a high tolerance, White Buffalo is not recommended for use at night because of its tendency to keep users awake and wired.These strong mental effects have medical applications as well. Patients with mild stress or depression may be able to channel White Buffalo’s emotional uplift into temporary relief from their troubling symptoms. Those with attention deficit disorders might find that the strain’s strong cerebral vibe helps them to sustain focus on a single task. White Buffalo has anti-inflammatory properties as well, making it an analgesic for mild aches and pains or headaches. Although dry mouth is a common undesirable side effect, patients who are prone to paranoia or anxiety should be more wary of White Buffalo’s tendency to bring about a disorienting mindrace.Seeds of White Buffalo are not available online, and any retailers purporting to sell such seeds should be investigated with some healthy consumer caution. Instead, prospective growers need to rely on clippings of mature plants that they can grow as genetically identical “clones.” White Buffalo can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Indoor growers should keep an eye on their plants’ growth -- this strain can stretch as tall as 6 feet, and growers may need to train stems and branches to fit within smaller spaces by trimming and pruning early in the vegetative stage. White Buffalo flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Depending on the phenotype, it offers growers a medium to high yield for their efforts.Somewhat difficult to come by, White Buffalo is not a strain to miss if it is spotted in a dispensary. It will please sativa lovers looking for a buzzy daytime strain with some traces of indica relaxation. White Buffalo’s high resin content also makes it valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Sharing its name with a documentary about legendary stoners The Grateful Dead, Sunshine Daydream is an indica-dominant hybrid that could earn the approval of Jerry Garcia himself. It was produced by prolific breeders Bodhi Seeds as a cross between two down-home strains: the Green Crack-descended Appalachia and a Bubba Kush-hybrid called Bubbashine. Sunshine Daydream offers smokers a hazy way to socialize or unwind after a long day. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Sunshine Daydream to have between 17% and 25% THC.Sunshine Daydream is marked by small to medium-sized buds that hold together in a dense bud structure. The leaves are tightly packed around their stems but are fluffy on their edges, giving the flowers a  ragged, spade-like appearance. Leaves are pale green and are offset by bright yellow to orange pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Some phenotypes also show off flashes of deep blue or purple -- possibly passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry, these hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by cold temperatures in the growing process. Cloudy white trichomes coat the flowers, giving them a white sheen and a very sticky texture; it may be difficult to break up the buds without the use of a grinder. The fruity aroma of berries jumps off of Sunshine Daydream’s flowers, but a stinging ammonia tang lurks underneath this predominantly fruity smell. Grinding or breaking open the buds shows off OG Kush’s influence, with more skunky notes. The smoke from this strain can be harsh and acrid, sometimes stinging users’ eyes and often inducing coughing. On the exhale, Sunshine Daydream tastes herbal and leaves behind a lingering, sour-sweet impression.Sunshine Daydream’s high creeps up slowly. Smokers are lulled into comfort with increasing waves of physical relaxation. A tingling feeling begins in the head and eventually spreads down through shoulders and limbs, often provoking the desire to grab the nearest seat. Soon, users may find that breathing is easier or that muscular tension has evaporated. There are some discernible mental effects as well -- true to its name, Sunshine Daydream offers a dreamy mindset that leaves users uplifted and sociable, but more hazy than cerebral and exacting. This soft euphora is right at home in isolated settings, or in small gatherings of familiar friends. Sunshine Daydream can be a great way to unwind in the early evening. If you’re enjoying it during the day, be sure to clear your calendar for a few hours.Sunshine Daydream’s happy sedation can be valuable to recreational cannabis patients as well. It can temporarily take the edge off of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe everything from normal aches and pains to nausea to migraines. In high enough doses, this strain can also provide relief from insomnia, easing smokers into a deep and fulfilling sleep. Because it doesn’t have much cerebral intensity, Sunshine Daydream may also come with a lower risk of paranoia.Although it may be difficult to come by in dispensaries, cannabis growers are in luck -- Bodhi sells seeds of Sunshine Daydream online; prospective growers can also obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow “clones.” This strain can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Indoor growing is easily accommodated, as plants have a characteristically short and bushy indica shape. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s purple-tinged bag appeal should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Sunshine Daydream flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It is known to be a pungent plant, and growers trying to keep their operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like exhaust fans.Just the thing for daydreaming in the park on a spring or summer afternoon, Sunshine Daydream offers all the appeal of a euphoric hybrid alongside the dank flavor profile that fans of Bubba and OG Kush fans love. This strain’s heavy, long-lasting body stone can definitely help roll away the dew.\n"

        "description": "Although Strawberry Banana seems like a taste combination best suited to a breakfast smoothie, it’s also the name of an indica-leaning hybrid developed by breeders Reserva Privada. Strawberry Banana is a cross between two fruity strains: Bubble Gum and Banana Kush. With a universally-appealing flavor and an easygoing, mellow high, this strain enjoys wide popularity in the U.S. west coast market. To top it all off, cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has consistently found flowers of Strawberry Banana to have between 17% and 23% THC with some higher testings topping out at 26%.Strawberry Banana has small to medium-sized flowers that maintain a tight, dense bud structure -- the tightly-packed leaves do not come easily off of their central stems. The leaves themselves appear light green with a yellowish tint and are set off by bright orange pistils. Some phenotypes of this strain are also flecked with purple, the result of pigments in the plant’s genetics being stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. A furry coating of white trichomes covers the flowers and accounts for their high THC. When properly cured, flowers of this strain have a sweet and mildly fruity taste, more like banana than strawberry.  Breaking open or grinding the buds yields a more hashy, spicy scent, betraying this strain’s OG Kush roots. Strawberry Banana offers a smooth, easy smoke when combusted and tastes distinctly like berries on the exhale. And while it may leave behind a fruity, creamy sensation, Strawberry Banana is also very pungent, so those trying to keep their consumption discreet should take caution.Like many strong indicas, Strawberry Banana has a high that builds slowly, often taking several minutes after smokers have savored its unique taste before fully revealing its effects. Users will eventually feel a sharpened sensory perception, and may feel like certain sights or sounds have taken on a psychedelic component. These trippy -- but not entirely cerebral -- effects can be well suited to enjoyment of low-key movies and music; they may also be just the thing for a long walk or a hike. Any initial mental impact from this strain is soon overtaken by powerful indica relaxation. Smokers may look to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings. Associative thinking persists throughout the high and may lend itself to creative thinking and problem solving. Couchlock is common in the later stages of the high. Because of its delayed sedative onset, Strawberry Banana is best suited to evening or nighttime use.This strain has many applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Those with anxiety or depression may feel temporary relief, as heightened senses may contribute to a feeling of being “in the moment.” Strawberry Banana’s sustained sense of focus can also be of use to patients with attention deficit disorders. Its sedative indica effects can provide relief from both moderate and acute aches and pains. On the downside, dry eyes and dry mouth are very common side effects.Several companies have made seeds of Strawberry Banana available for purchase online, but consumers be sure that they’re buying from reputable sellers. Growers can also obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Strawberry Banana is forgiving on novice growers and can be grown indoors or out -- although successful outdoor cultivation depends on humid daytime conditions with temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Those looking to bring out the leaves’ eye-catching purple potential should also artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to cold temperatures at night. Strawberry Banana is a big yielder, offering growers between 42 to 51 grams (or 1.2 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.After the meticulous process of harvesting their buds, growers should also properly cure the flowers to maintain their valuable resin. Curing involves first hanging the buds upside-down to dry for one week in conditions of 50% humidity and 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then sealing them in airtight jars in 70 degrees and 60-65% humidity.Strawberry Banana’s well-balanced high is right at home in a variety of settings, from introspective solo unwinding to buzzy, social surroundings. It is especially appropriate for parties, where its unique aroma is sure to turn a few heads. This strain’s high resin production also makes it particularly useful in producing hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s potency at between 14% and a staggering 24%.Sour Grape has small to medium-sized flowers that appear spherical in shape when fully cured.  The tiny buds adhere in a dense and heavy indica structure, with the leaves tightly coiled around central stems. The leaves themselves are a dull, earthy shade of dark green; although many phenotypes boast vibrant streaks of purple. These purple hues are the result of a process akin to changes in autumn foliage, and are the result of high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins being excited by colder than average temperatures in the growing process. Trichomes dot the outer and inner surfaces of the leaves and appear more dewy and transparent than white and opaque. Regardless of its color, however, the resin makes these flowers incredibly sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. Flowers of Sour Grape have a unique aroma that appeals to fans of both dank and more fruity strains. The predominant smell is a chemical, fuel-like funk, clearly passed on from Sour Diesel. Almost as strong in intensity, the  tangy, slightly tropical scent of fruit blooms just underneath. When combusted, Sour Grape has a surprisingly smooth smoke and tastes simultaneously grape-like and skunky on the exhale. It is important to note that this strain’s signature grape flavor is coincidental to its purple coloring -- the pigments that produce Sour Grape’s shades of violet jjave no corresponding effect on the strain’s taste.Sour Grape has a multi-dimensional that begins with a fast-acting headrush. Smokers are hit with a quick pressure around the eyes and temples, and may detect some increased salivation at the back of the palate. Depending on their set and setting, this headrush may also make users feel dizzy or off-balance. Psychedelic effects like visual distortions and a sense of time dilation may also be common. Although Sour Grape may stimulate users’ thoughts, it is unlikely to trigger the kind of intense, free-associative “mindrace” associated with purer sativas. As the high progresses, a feeling of relaxation creeps in and may inspire smokers to seek rest in the most comfortable nearby surroundings available. However relaxed they may be, though, smokers remain more mentally lucid than dreamy or hazy. Sour Grape provides the energy needed to accomplish a day’s tasks. Because it stimulates the body and mind, it can also serve as a great accompaniment for activities that involve both -- including, both not limited to, exercise and sex. Because it makes room for a bit of cerebral activity, Sour Grape may not be the best strain to enjoy just before bed.Just as it is recreationally versatile, this strain has a variety of uses for medical cannabis patients. Its late-blooming indica relaxation can provide relief from troubling aches and pains. More commonly, its uplift in mood may allow temporary relief from acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Sour Grape’s long-lasting, clearheaded focus can even help patients with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. Because its cerebral effects are limited, Sour Grape comes with a decreased potential for inciting anxiety or paranoia.There is limited public information available on cultivation of Sour Grape. Seeds do not seem to be commercially available; instead, prospective growers must obtain clippings from healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Because it is a hybrid, Sour Grape can be well-managed and maintained in indoor grow operations, and can grow wild and free outdoors in Mediterranean-like climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out this strain’s trademark flashes of purple should expose plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Both the Sour Diesel and Grandaddy Purple parent strains flower within a relatively lengthy 10 to 11 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, this strain remains particularly pungent from seedling to flower, so growers trying to keep their operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters. As enjoyable in chatty social settings as it is introspective solo situations, Sour Grape is a potent and well-rounded crossbreed. Its funky-fruity taste and middle-of-the-road effects make it a great option for those seeking bold grape taste without heavy indica sedation.\n"

        "description": "The boldly-named Purple Dragon is an indica-leaning hybrid. It is a cross between the Mendocino Purps-descended Purple Urkle and Blue Dragon, itself a cross between powerhouse strains Sour Diesel and Blueberry. Of the many strains in the ever-growing “Purple family.” Purple Dragon is one of the most striking, with incredible colors and flavors and potent (yet easygoing) effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Purple Dragon to have between 14% and 20% THC.Purple Dragon has medium-sized, shape-shaped nuggets that are immediately eye-catching. The flowers hold together in a dense, solid formation, characteristic of other indica varieties. The tightly-spiraling leaves are usually mossy green, threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Depending on the phenotype, these buds may also be highlighted by varying patches of deep blue and purple. These latter colors come about when high concentrations of pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The already-colorful flowers are made even more colorful by a dusting of cloudy white trichomes. This resin also gives the buds a sticky texture and makes them particularly difficult to break up by hand. Purple Dragon also has a dynamic taste to match its visual bag appeal. A tart, fruity aroma wafts up from the buds, likely passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry. Also present is a slight chemical astringency, reminiscent of the gasoline odor of Sour Diesel. When combusted, this strain gives off a very smooth that has notes of musk and hash alongside its fruity palate. Notably, any grape flavors present in Purple Dragon’s smoke are incidental; the pigments that determine its purple color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.Purple Dragon’s high is almost imperceptible at first, but slowly creeps up on the user, emerging as a pressure in the face, particularly behind the eyes. Smokers may also detect some increased salivation at the back of the tongue. Relaxing indica properties reveal themselves first -- a heavy head and droopy eyelids may prompt users to sit down and settle into the most comfortable and familiar surroundings. As the high progresses, a mild but persistent head high may also spring up to accompany this thorough body stone: the user’s thoughts may happily drift from one to the next. A feeling of emotional uplift may be present as well. Because it relaxes the mind as well as the body, lowering the usual inhibitions of convention and logic, Purple Dragon can be good for creative or analytical thinking. It is also well-suited to passive activities like psychedelic enjoyment of music or movies. Long-lasting even for even experienced cannabis users, Purple Dragon can be consumed at any time of day … although its slight sativa edge may keep smokers wired around bedtime.Purple Dragon also has many applications for medical cannabis patients. Its heavy indica sedation can soothe moderate to chronic aches and pains. Anti-inflammatory properties also make it an effective treatment for everything from nausea to migraines. Psychologically speaking, Purple Dragon’s euphoric effects can blunt the troubling symptoms of depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Its sense of lucid focus may also help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain their focus. In large enough doses, this strain can also combat stubborn cases of insomnia.No breeding companies have claimed responsibility for Purple Dragon’s creation and no seeds of the strain have yet been released for commercial sale. Instead, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Like many other hybrids, this strain can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Growers are urged to bring out Purple Dragon’s full purple potential by exposing plants to cold nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a medium to high yield.Mellow and balanced, Purple Dragon is versatile enough for use in a variety of sets and settings -- it can facilitate conversation among good friends or can provide the relaxation needed to unwind after a long day of work.\n"

        "description": "Modern presidential politics can be insanely stressful. Luckily, Presidential OG may be just the thing to take the edge off of a hectic campaign. This heavy indica was developed as a cross between award-winning Bubble Gum and none other than OG Kush. With a sweet and piney flavor profile, it’s a great choice for flavor-focused connoisseurs. Presidential OG may even convert some sativa lovers with its easygoing, clearheaded euphoria. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 measures this hybrid’s THC content at between 15% and 26%.Presidential OG is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that cling together in popcorn-like formations. The buds have a characteristically indica structure, heavy and densely packed together. Its leaves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are threaded through with rust-colored pistils. Some phenotypes of Presidential OG also show off streaks of faint purple, a shade that comes about when anthocyanin pigments are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The strain’s flowers are blanketed in cloudy white trichomes, giving them a silvery sheen and a sticky texture. When properly cured, buds of Presidential OG carry the rich, woodsy scent of pine. A slightly lemony tang also lurks underneath. Breaking up or grinding the flowers yields notes of spice and incense from the strain’s Kush lineage. When combusted, Presidential OG burns with a surprisingly smooth smoke and tastes dank and hashy on the exhale. Notably, there are no discernible grape flavors -- this is because the pigments that create occasional purple hues do not have a corresponding effect on the strain’s taste.The high from Presidential OG sets in quickly for an indica. Shortly after ingestion, waves of relaxation spread outward from the core and down through the limbs. Smokers may breathe more easily and their eyelids may feel increasingly heavy. More dreamy than cerebral, this strain will elevate the smoker’s general sense of well-being, making it a great asset in buzzy social settings. As dosage is bumped up, couchlock may set in, sapping any productivity and keeping users pinned in place. Because of its thoroughly sleepy nature, Presidential OG is a good strain to use at night when unwinding after a long day.Presidential OG also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can be an effective analgesic for troublesome aches and pains. It can also slow down a racing mind and temporarily blunt the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This strain is also prized an antidote to insomnia. Presidential OG comes with a lower risk of paranoia, making it a good choice for patients who are prone to panic.Dutch producers Royal Queen has made seeds of Presidential OG available for sale online. It may not be the easiest strain to grow and is not recommended for newcomers to cultivation. It can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. When grown indoors, it can spread its branches and thrive, with short, bushy plants that rarely exceed three feet in height. Growers should keep tabs on moisture levels in any growing operation, as this strain can be particularly susceptible to mold and rot. Those looking to bring out Presidential OG’s colorful hues should also artificially “shock” their plants by exposing them to cold nighttime temperatures toward the end of the vegetative stage. Flowering happens within 8 to 9 weeks when the strain is grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. Presidential OG yields about 46 grams (or 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.After harvesting their buds, growers of Presidential OG should also be sure to properly cure their buds. Curing is a two-stage process that involves first hanging fresh flowers upside down to dry for a week in ambient conditions of 50% humidity and 70 degrees Fahrenheit; and then sealing the dried buds in airtight jars in conditions of about 65% humidity and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.Whether or not you can stand to keep your TV tuned to the news, Presidential OG is a great choice for a mellow night in at home. If you do bring it out to a party, though, be prepared to share, as its dynamic aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Sometimes a strain can bie successfully crossed with itself -- although it may sound counterintuitive, the exchange of traits from markedly different phenotypes of a single variety can yield amazing results. P-91 is a great example of this experimental breeding: it is the product of a Northern Lights female crossed with a Northern Lights male, and then back-crossed a third time with the original Northern Lights mother plant. There is also some conjecture that P-91 may in fact be the child of a Skunk #1 female and a Thai landrace male.Whatever its genetic background, though, cannabis breeders generally agree that this strain originated in Poway, a town in San Diego County, California in 1991 (hence its name). P-91 is a stable and potent strain that shows off all the qualities that made Northern Lights famous: strong and long-lasting indica relaxation alongside a buzzy sativa edge. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 clocks its THC content at an impressive 20%.Flowers of P-91 appear small to medium in size and hold a dense, indica-typical formation, with particularly wide leaves coiled around their stems. The vibrant green leaves are threaded through with orange to brown pistils. Amber trichomes cover the buds, giving them a slightly yellow tint and an incredibly sticky texture -- this is one strain that’s very hard to break up without the use of a grinder. At first, users are struck by the flowers’ bright citrus scent. On closer inspection, there’s also a slightly astringent tang, reminiscent of ammonia cleaning products. Breaking open the buds yields more spicy notes, presumably inherited from grandparent strain Afghani. When combusted, P-91 gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting eyes and sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, it tastes sweet and lemony with some traces of damp earth.P-91 takes effect quickly, beginning as a pressure around the eyes and temples. Smokers may soon perceive external stimuli more intensely than before -- certain colors or sounds may take on an entirely new dimension. A while later, after they have adjusted to their altered states, this head buzz melts into a stoney body high. Worries and muscular tension both dissipate as relaxed smokers sink into the closest comfortable surroundings. P-91 still keeps its fans lucid, though, and while it may not be the best strain for productivity and problem-solving, it’s great for creative thinking. It can also be a good way to enhance appreciation of psychedelic music and art. As this high wears on, couchlock may set in, providing the perfect setting for thoughts to wander or for stimulating conversation to flow.Just as its recreational uses are both mental and physical, P-91 has a wide range of benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its feelings of enhanced perception may help those with stress or depression to live more acutely in the moment. Its sustained focus can also be an aid to people with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically speaking, P-91 can soothe aches and pains, whether incidental as caused by injury or chronic, due to conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia. Finally, in high enough doses, this strain may be able to combat stubborn cases of insomnia.No breeding operations have released seeds of this elusive strain for commercial sale. Those looking to grow it should obtain clippings from mature plants of P-91 in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. It is easily accommodated indoors, though, with its short, bushy plants. Growers should be sure to “top” their plants regularly by pruning away any wide fan leaves that could prevent light and air from reaching the low-growing flowering nodes. Growers will also need to be patient, as P-91 has a long flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and early November when grown outdoors.With solid landrace roots, P-91 is a testament to the advantages of restricted breeding. All the great stoney and spacey qualities of Northern Lights are distilled in this easygoing strain. Its high resin production also makes it very well-suited to the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Why is it spelled “sherbet” but pronounced “sherbert”? That’s one of many possible questions for you to ponder as you partake in the hazy, relaxing high of Sunset Sherbet. This strain is an indica-dominant cross between Girl Scout Cookies and the scandalously-named Pink Panties, said to be derived from Blackberry Kush. Sunset Sherbet offers best of both genetic worlds: an energizing sativa high grounded by full-body indica relaxation. Sunset Sherbet’s complex flavor profile is also sure to make it a hit in social settings. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has clocked its potency at between 18% and 24% THC.Sunset Sherbet is distinguished by medium to large-sized flowers that hold together in a dense, indica-typical structure. The wide leaves are a vibrant spring green, set off by rust-colored pistils. In certain phenotypes, flowers show flashes of deep purple; these hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Sticky trichomes dot the already-colorful flowers, giving them a silvery sheen. The aroma of sweet berries and fresh orange zest jumps off of the cured buds, a tantalizing combination of Sunset Sherbet’s parent strains. On closer inspection, a skunky pungency lurks underneath the fruity tones, while grinding up or breaking open the nugs reveals the strain’s dank, hashy odors, courtesy of grandparent strain OG Kush. When combusted, Sunset Sherbet has a harsh smoke that may sting eyes and sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, this smoke leaves behind a tart, saccharine taste. Notably, the anthocyanin pigments that give this strain its unique purple color do not have a corresponding effect on taste, and flavors of grape are rarely detected in Sunset Sherbet’s flowers.Sunsetsherbert is a tasty, colorful hybrid that starts off with a powerful body stone, followed by a zing of mental stimulation. This cross between Blackberry Kush and Girl Scout Cookies shows off some remarkable green and purple flowers covered in a thick coat of trichomes. Sunset Sherbet smells like berries and citrus with a little bit of skunk lurking underneath. The predominantly indica high creeps up slowly, eventually sinking smokers with a droopy feeling of total relaxation. A thoughtful, dreamy mindset kicks in a little bit later on, making this a great strain for working on creative projects or just watching TV. This is the perfect strain for kicking back on a warm summer evening. If you’re busting it out in social situations, make sure you bring enough to share.Like many other indicas, Sunset Sherbet has a high that mounts slowly, often taking several minutes after a toke before its effects are fully detected. What begins as a pressure in the eyes and forehead soon melts into droopy relaxation in the limbs and torso, leaving smokers content to crash in the closest comfortable surroundings. A little bit of this strain goes a long way, and even more experienced users may not need much to feel the full weight of its sedation. That’s not to say that Sunset Sherbet is without mental stimulation, however. Even if users stay couchlocked, they may find that this variety provokes imaginative thinking and daydreaming and keeps the mind lucid and alert. Sunset Sherbet brings about a uniquely uplifted and social vibe that works especially well in small social gatherings with trusted friends. It’s appropriate for use at any time of day -- but, true to its name, Sunset Sherbet is a particularly good dessert-time treat.Sunset Sherbet also has value for medical cannabis patients. Psychologically speaking, it can provide temporary relief for those suffering from depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. It may also clear blockages in emotional or creative energy with its cerebral yet easygoing nature. More physiologically, this strain’s pseudo-narcotic effects can numb aches and pains, whether incidental as due to injury or chronic from conditions like arthritis or lupus. It may also stoke hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. With its optimal balance between stimulation and relaxation, Sunset Sherbet comes with a lower risk of paranoia and is great for those with anxiety disorders of with a low THC tolerance.Unfortunately, seeds of Sunset Sherbet have not been made available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow clones. This strain can be grown indoors or out, although success growing outdoors is dependent on semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. Sunset Sherbet’s plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers are encouraged to “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that may prevent light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Sunset Sherbet’s purple potential should also expose the plants to cold nighttime temperatures shortly before flowering. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Sunset Sherbet is a perfect strain to enjoy with some psychedelic music or a visually-stimulating movie. It has also proven useful in crossbreeding -- among others, it’s been bred with Girl Scout Cookies to yield Gelato, a hybrid that may make a great follow-up dessert course to this flavorful strain.\n"

        "description": "Blue Mango is an indica-dominant hybrid with some serious bag appeal. Colorful and flavorful, it provides a calm, euphoric high. A few different strains have been proposed for Blue Mango’s parentage -- some claim it’s descended from DJ Short’s cut of Blueberry and powerhouse indica William’s Wonder while others say it’s the product of Mango Kush and the ever-popular Blue Dream. Whatever its lineage, Blue Mango delivers lasting relaxation and is potent even for veteran cannabis users.Flowers of Blue Mango are medium to large in size and have the long, tapered buds more characteristic of sativa varieties. The fluffy, somewhat ragged leaves pull away relatively easily from their central stems. They appear pale green and are offset by rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Some phenotypes of Blue Mano also express deep blue and purple hues in their leaves. These latter colors emerge when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by cold weather in the growing process, similar to the process that causes foliage to change color in autumn. Trichomes cover these multicolored flowers, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity and giving it a very resinous texture. A mouthwatering blueberry scent jumps off of the cured buds, leaving little doubt that Blueberry is somewhere in Blue Mango’s lineage. Hanging out underneath this aroma is an overly sweet, almost sour funk. When combusted, this strain has a harsh smoke that may trigger coughing and watery eyes. A tropical-tinged blueberry flavor comes through when smoke is exhaled. This unique taste is best savored in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe.Blue Mango hits quickly for an indica, conferring almost instant relaxation. Smokers may suddenly find that they’re able to breathe more easily and may sense a relief of any pent-up physical tension. Although this strain’s high is mellow and sedative, it won’t necessarily incapacitate you, keeping you mobile and energetic if you need to get things done. That said, the likelihood of couchlock increases as greater amounts of this bud are consumed. Any mental effects from Blue Mango arrive as a generally elevated sense of well-being. Rather than thoughtful and analytical, users may end up feeling pleasantly hazy. This combination of physical sedation and an easygoing mindset makes this variety great for low-key socializing or just daydreaming and kicking back at home. Because of its ultimately sleepy vibes, Blue Mango is better suited to nighttime than afternoon use.Medical cannabis patients may also find value in Blue Mango’s sedative properties. Its anti-inflammatory benefits may soothe anything from troublesome aches and pains to migraines. It can also temporarily relieve the symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. Finally, Blue Mango’s thorough relaxation may cure particularly stubborn cases of insomnia, granting deep and restful sleep.No cannabis breeders have stepped forward to claim responsibility for Blue Mango’s creation and none have released seeds of the strain for commercial. As such, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically healthy clones. While there’s limited information available on best practices for cultivating this strain, its mostly indica nature implies short, bushy plants with strong lateral branches. Growers should “top” these small plants by pruning away any broad fan leaves that can block light from reaching low-growing flowering nodes.  Those looking to bring out Blue Mango’s full visual potential should also artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to cold temperatures just before flowering begins.Blue Mango is a great example of a hybrid that doesn’t sacrifice potency for flavor or an eye-catching appearance. It’s a tasty treat to enjoy while out with friends or during a slow, introspective night in.\n"

        "description": "Cannabis lovers always seem to be on the hunt for hybrid strains that combine mental stimulation with calming physical effects. Luckily, they don’t need to search as frantically as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’s Charlie Bucket to find the reward they seek. The strain Golden Ticket, created by Portland’s Archive Seeds is a cross between colorful hybrid Golden Goat and heavy indica Face Off OG. Golden Ticket offers a supremely balanced high and a flavor profile that is an appealing blend of citrus and skunk.Consumers should keep in mind that Golden Ticket also describes a lesser-seen distinct phenotype of TGA Genetic’s potent hybrid Chernobyl. If you spot Golden Ticket for sale, asking a knowledgeable budtender about its exact genetics should clear up any uncertainty.Golden Ticket is marked by medium-sized flowers that adhere in thick, chunky nuggets. These flowers have a very dense bud structure, with thin leaves packed and coiled tightly around their central stems. True to its name, Golden Ticket’s leaves are pale green with a discernible yellow tint. The flowers are also threaded through with yellow to orange hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). A heavy dusting of trichomes ensures this strain’s psychoactivity and gives it a very sticky texture -- Golden Ticket is sure to leave a coating of resin on the fingertips if broken up by hand. The most obvious aroma is a tropical lemon-lime tang, likely passed on from parent strain Golden Goat, which is itself descended from a Hawaiian landrace. This fruity smell is undercut by the musky scent of damp earth. Grinding up or breaking open the dense nugs gives off a faint chemical scent of ammonia. When combusted, Golden Ticket burns with a smooth smoke that tastes both citrus and sweet and may linger on the palate for a while.Golden Ticket offers a slow, creeping high that may take several minutes before its initial effects are even noticed. Users may detect a slightly altered perception of external stimuli. Colors and sounds may seem more intense, and otherwise mundane concepts may strike the smoker as more interesting. This contributes to a slightly trippy, psychedelic feeling. Golden Ticket is not entirely dreamy, though -- users often remain in full control of their faculties and able to maintain lucid thoughts and conversations. As the high wears on, a warm sense of relaxation radiates out from the core and may provoke the desire to sit down and take a load off. Be warned: a little bit of Golden Ticket may make you feel slightly lazy, while a few bowls are liable to render you bedridden like Charlie Bucket’s Grandpa Joe. This multi-faceted high can be put to use however the smoker desires. It can be great for daydreaming or light creative work at home. It’s also an excellent way to enhance an extended nature walk or to facilitate buzzy conversation with friends.Golden Ticket has diverse benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also take the edge off of annoyances like headaches and stomach problems. In high enough doses, this strain’s thorough sedation can temporarily blunt the harsh symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD, and can ease insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because its effects run the gamut from stimulating to relaxing, Golden Ticket is appropriate for use at any time of day.Archive has made seeds of Golden Ticket available to growers for sale online; alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow clones. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants can show either bushy indica or tall sativa characteristics, depending on the individual phenotype. Golden Ticket flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.Consider yourself lucky if you run across this versatile hybrid. Its balance of thoughtfulness and relaxation is just the thing to help you feel like you could jump over the moon in ecstasy -- or to simply unwind at home after a long day.\n"

        "description": "For many, the words ÔÇ£allen wrenchÔÇØ conjure up those pesky, easy-to-lose tools that come packaged with unassembled modular furniture. For some cannabis lovers, though, Allen Wrench sparks thoughts of productivity and motivation. The Allen Wrench strain is a mostly sativa cross between potent sativa Trainwreck and landrace-derived hybrid NYC Diesel. With a simultaneously fruity and sour bouquet, this strain is sure to leave an impression on the palate -- but itÔÇÖs primarily known for its ability to ratchet up usersÔÇÖ higher-order thinking and to inspire creativity. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Allen Wrench to have between 16% and a staggering 28% THC content.Allen WrenchÔÇÖs bag appeal is established by some very visually impressive flowers. The nugget-like blossoms are medium to large and have the long, tapered appearance typical of other sativa varieties; depending on the individual plant phenotype, flowers may range in shape from spade-like to almost cylindrical. The leaves are tightly packed together in a dense bud structure and are a mossy green, threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. An abundance of glassy white trichomes give the flowers a sheen and a resinous texture. This is an especially hard strain to break apart without the use of a grinder. When Allen Wrench is properly cured, it gives off the stench of gasoline, an odor inherited from its NYC Diesel parent strain. A skunky tang can also be detected, while grinding up or breaking open the buds yields a faint citrus smell. Allen Wrench burns with a very smooth smoke that tastes earthy and distinctly lemony on the exhale. Smokers should note that this is a particularly pungent smoke - those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take the necessary precautions.The high from Allen Wrench comes on quickly as a headrush, accompanied by a mounting pressure behind the eyes and temples. Users may also notice some increased salivation at first. Almost immediately, smokers will detect a change in perception: otherwise mundane objects or experiences can take on new significance, worthy of deep analysis. This kind of free-associative thinking may stoke creative, artistic work; it can also allow for cerebral problem-solving, helping users to see an entrenched challenge from a new angle. As the high wears on and users become accustomed to this altered state, Allen WrenchÔÇÖs cerebral nature can become more comfortable. In social settings, this may lend itself to stimulating conversation -- or even just a few shared giggles. Because it keeps smokers alert at best and jittery at worst, Allen Wrench is an excellent choice for daytime productivity, but is not always the best option for nighttime use.Because of its predominantly sativa vibes, Allen WrenchÔÇÖs medical applications are more psychological than physiological. It can help patients with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on single tasks. It can also clear a cluttered mind that may be distracted by stress or a busy schedule. Because of its tendency towards intense recursive thinking, though, Allen Wrench is not recommended for those who tend towards anxiety or paranoia.Allen WrenchÔÇÖs original breeders are as yet unknown, and its original seed stock has not been released for commercial sale. Instead, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. This finicky variety may not be the best choice for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Indoors, Allen Wrench can stretch to impressive heights, especially during the flowering period. As such, growers are encouraged to train and stunt its vertical growth by trimming and pruning plants early in the vegetative stage. As is typical of purer sativas, this strain has a very long flowering time of about 10 to 11 weeks when grown indoors. It can also be a very smelly crop, and those trying to keep a low profile should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Allen WrenchÔÇÖs potent psychoactivity is an asset to cannabis veterans who can wrangle its persistent mind race to produce creative and thoughtful output. Well suited to daytime -- and particularly morning -- use, its long-lasting sativa buzz is just the thing for thinking outside the box, or for simply appreciating the thousands of new experiences that every day has to offer.\n"

        "description": "Dutch Berry (sometimes spelled Dutchberry) is a sativa-dominant hybrid developed by Washington state-based growers Artizen Cannabis. It is a cross between hybrid Dutch Treat sand breeder DJ Short’s signature cut of Blueberry. Dutch Berry comes with all the flavor you’d expect of a blueberry cross, but with the added benefit of therapeutic CBD; parent strain Dutch Treat contains trace amounts of the cannabinoid and Dutch Berry has been selectively bred to have as much as 8% CBD. This strain is no slouch when it comes to THC, though -- Artizen claims THC levels as high as 27%. With a powerful but balanced high and a standout flavor profile, Dutch Berry is appropriate for use in a wide variety of settings.This strain is marked by chunky, medium-sized flowers. Although the buds have a typically indicia structure, with dense, tightly-coiled leaves, the shape of the flowers leans more sativa, appearing tapered and spade-like. The leaves themselves are a surprisingly dark shade of forest green. This uniform color is punctuated by a relatively small amount of hairy orange pistils. Cloudy white trichomes dot the outsides of the flowers, giving this strain a particularly sticky texture. The sweet and rich aroma of berries pops off of Dutch Treat’s cured flowers, accented by some notes of citrus hanging out underneath. Breaking or grinding the buds gives off a pungent musk, perhaps due to the influence of grandparent strain Afghani. When combusted Dutch Berry gives off a smooth smoke that is easily inhaled. On the exhale, it leaves behind a tart berry taste, undercut by a distinct skunkiness.Dutch Berry’s high comes on quickly, hitting the user with an initially spacey, disorienting headrush. Rather than generate long-lasting confusion, though, this strain is more likely to keep smokers focused as they adjust to their altered perception. Thoughts or feelings may take on a new, more intense dimension. A buzzy and active mood tends to pervade the high, and as a result, otherwise mundane tasks like cleaning or shopping may pass more quickly and pleasantly. Dutch Berry is also a great accompaniment for activities like playing video games. It’s unlikely that smokers will end up couchlocked or otherwise incapacitated; instead, they may be prone to a certain kind of FOMO (fear of missing out) that comes with boosted energy and a cerebral mindset. Because it can leave users unusually wired, this is one strain that should be avoided just before bedtime.Dutch Berry has several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Although some breeders attempt to isolate CBD for its sedative and painkilling properties, Dutch Berry contains both CBD and THC. As such, it offers to opportunity to enjoy a thought-provoking high while still feeling at ease and relieved of chronic aches and pains. Dutch Berry’s sense of alertness and immediacy can also be good for patients struggling with stress and depression, as it may help them to live “in the moment,” with greater holistic awareness. Its sustained focus can also aid those with attention deficit disorders in concentrating on a single task. Because of Dutch Berry’s initial cerebral stimulation, it is not recommended patients prone to paranoia or anxiety.Artizen has not made seeds of Dutch Berry available for commercial sale. Prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of this strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Those who are lucky enough to get their hands on a starter plant will have success growing Dutch Berry indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation requires warm, semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Although there is limited information available on growing this strain, we know that both of its parents have characteristically indica plant types, so growers can likely expect short and bushy crops with strong lateral branches. Dutch Treat and Blueberry also offer a moderate to high yield, so growers of Dutch Berry may expect the same.Very popular in the Pacific Northwest, Dutch Berry is poised to find success in the newly legal West Coast cannabis market. With a crowd-pleasing taste and a social, chatty vibe, it may be the perfect ice breaker at a party.\n"

        "description": "Cherries Jubilee is a mysterious, mostly indica hybrid with a dynamic taste and a potent body high. It was created by prolific Washington state-based producers Northwest Cannabis Solutions who have kept the strain’s genetic makeup a proprietary secret. Given Cherries Jubilee’s signature flavor profile and heavy, stoney feeling, though, it feels safe to conjecture that Cherry Kush or Cherry OG lie somewhere in its lineage. Northwest Cannabis Solutions measures this hybrid’s potency at a solid 18% THC.Buds of Cherries Jubilee are classic indica: they adhere in very dense clumps, with the leaves tightly curled around their central stems. The wide leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with hairy brown to orange pistils. Cloudy white trichomes cover the flowers inside and out, giving them a very sticky texture -- this strain may be difficult to break up without the aid of a quality grinder. As one might expect, the primary aroma of this strain is tart cherries; some sweet berry notes are also mixed in, underscoring the flowers’ bag appeal. Surprisingly for an indica, Cherries Jubilee has very little underlying skunk or musk. Grinding up or breaking open the buds yields even more of a fruity scent. When combusted, this strain gives off a smooth smoke that tastes sweet and fruity on the exhale, with a subtle hint of cherry.Cherries Jubilee has a sneaky high that mounts slowly. After several minutes, smokers may feel a tingle in the neck that eventually spreads down through the core and limbs. Waves of relaxation ebb and flow, making the user content to kick back in the closest comfortable surroundings. Any mental effects from this strain come through in the form of palpable emotional uplift -- Cherries Jubilee won’t keep your thoughts running in circles, leaving you free to have a rambling, stimulating conversation with friends or to just kick back with TV and some snacks. Be warned that sedative effects intensify as dosage is increased, and after a few bowls you may find yourself pinned to the couch. A potent and long-lasting strain even for experienced cannabis users, Cherries Jubilee is more of an evening or nighttime strain.Cherries Jubilee has significant benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sedative and anti-inflammatory properties can help soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic and disease-related. Its mental tranquility can also provide short-term relief from the troubling symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. In high enough doses, Cherries Jubilee can even be an effective treatment for insomnia, lulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Because of the relatively low-grade cerebral effects, this strain comes with a lower risk of paranoia and may be appropriate for users who are prone to anxiety or who have a low THC tolerance.Northwest Cannabis Solutions has not made seeds of this tasty strain available for sale online. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of Cherries Jubilee in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is limited information available on its ideal cultivation, we know that it can be successfully grown indoors or out (although outdoor growing requires warm, Mediterranean-like climates). Because of its primarily indica nature, it’s also a safe bet that plants of this strain grow low and bushy and can easily be accommodated in indoor spaces.Something of a cannabis dessert delicacy, Cherries Jubilee enjoys wide popularity in the Pacific Northwest. In addition to flowers, this strain’s producers also sell concentrated preparations like vape cartridges that retain all of that fruity goodness. Enjoy this indica at a laid-back party...but once people get a whiff, be prepared to share.\n"

        "description": "Lemon Wreck (also known as Lemon Trainwreck) is a cross between the distinctive-tasting Lemon Diesel and the notoriously potent sativa Trainwreck. This complex hybrid offers a very strong citrus flavor profile along with a dynamic mix of mental and physical effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has tested multiple flowers of Lemon Wreck and has found them to have a consistent THC content of about 15%.Lemon Wreck’s distinctive flowers are larger than average and have a long, almost cylindrical shape. The wispy leaves hold together in a loose, sativa-typical bud structure and can pull away easily from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green, accented by brown to rust-colored hairy pistils. These flowers are also very resinous, covered in trichomes that range in color from transparent to milky white, depending on the individual plant phenotype. As you might expect, the predominant aroma wafting off of these chunky buds is of sour lemon. Some notes of skunk and diesel hang around underneath, balancing out the primary citrus impression. Lemon Wreck burns smoothly and is easily inhaled when combusted. On the exhale, it has a sour, mouth-puckering taste. It also has a pungency that can linger for a while after users have enjoyed a toke; anyone looking to keep their smoking discreet should take the necessary precautions.Lemon Wreck’s cerebral effects arrive early, making themselves known with a bracing pressure in the forehead and around the eyes. Shortly after they’ve savored this strain’s unique flavor, users are struck with with a suddenly acute perception of external stimuli and an increased suggestibility to their own racing thoughts. Once smokers have adjusted to this altered state, they may find themselves able to enjoy the trip by indulging in some boldly-flavored snacks or by watching a particularly trippy movie. Within relatively little time, Lemon Wreck’s full psychoactive potential blooms in the form of deep relaxation. Discernible indica effects spread down from the neck, through the core and limbs, helping users to feel less tense and allowing them to breathe more easily. Eventually, smokers may find themselves pinned to the closest couch. Any of this strain’s early cerebral or analytical vibes soon give way to a cloudy, daydreaming mindset, making Lemon Wreck a perfect choice for early evening to night time use. For optimal effect, toke on these flowers at least two to three hours before heading to bed.Just as Lemon Wreck can have both mental and physical users for the recreational smoker, it can also have various applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sedation may numb aches and pains -- whether incidental, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe headaches and stomachaches of varying degrees of severity. In high enough doses, Lemon Wreck can also prove beneficial in trenchant cases of insomnia. Because of its initial surge of sativa intensity, this may not be the best variety for those who experience frequent panic, or those who have a lower than average tolerance for THC.No single commercial breeder has claimed responsibility for Lemon Wreck’s creation, and none have released the strain’s seeds for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although growing calls for semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Like many sativa-dominant strains, it has a long flowering time of about 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers growers a moderate yield of about 42 grams (or 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Finally, just as it is a pungent smoke, Lemon Wreck can be a very smelly strain to grow; growers may want into invest in odor-control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Lemon Wreck’s singular psychoactive profile -- in which an early sativa kick gives way to a mellow and thorough indica body stone -- is a great choice for small gatherings of friends who know each other well. It’s also a good option for simply unwinding at home after a long day or week at work.\n"

        "description": "Panda OG joins a growing roster of high-quality hybrids coming out of Washington state. Created by breeders Grow Op Farms based in the Spokane Valley, this sativa-leaning strain is part of the producers’ Phat Panda branded line. It is a cross between OG Chem and the lesser-seen Berry Sour Cream, and offers a complex set of flavors alongside a potent head buzz. Panda OG’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and an impressive 25%.Flowers of Panda OG are mostly visually unimpressive; they are small and hold a more sativa-typical bud structure, with somewhat fluffy, ragged leaves that can tear away easily from central stems. The leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with yellow to orange hairs. The primarily aroma of these buds is redolent of sweet berries, passed on from parent strain Berry Sour Cream. On closer inspection, the unmistakable chemical odor of ammonia also wafts up from the flowers, undoubtedly passed on from pungent Chem OG. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the buds yields some dank, Kushy notes. When combusted, Panda OG burns with a harsh, cough-inducing smoke. It may have an acrid, sour tang on the exhale, flecked by hints of berry flavor.Born and bred in Washington state, Panda OG is a sativa-leaning cross between OG Chem and Berry Sour Cream. The small, popcorny nugs have fluffy leaves that are a dark shade of forest green. A tangy berry scent springs off of the flowers. There’s also a little bit of spice and incense passed on from the strain’s OG Kush genetics and a chemical odor passed on from its Chemdawg side. An energizing, bouncy head high sets in quickly, making smokers’ thoughts jump quickly from one to the next. It can aid focus on complicated analytical tasks or can just keep a friendly conversation humming along. There’s also a slight onset of indica relaxation, especially as dosage is increased. Panda OG is great for either \"Wake N Bake\" or evening use. A little bit goes a long way, too -- this strain’s THC has been measured at levels as high as 25%.Panda OG has a high that comes on quickly, manifesting as a distinct pressure around the eyes and temples. Smokers often notice a sharpening of their senses; visual and audio stimuli can take on new dimensions, even seeming somewhat psychedelic in nature. Thoughts may also come with a new intensity, making Panda OG perfect for creative visualization or analytical problem-solving. As the high progresses, a slight indica body high creeps in, allowing users to breathe more easily and possible even inspiring them to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings. Despite this increased physical relaxation, though, consumers of Panda OG are able to maintain focus and lucidity for the duration of the high. The unique blend of action on mind and body makes this strain a good accompaniment to activities that involve a combination of physical coordination and mental acuity -- for example, video games, exercise, and sex. A little bit of this adorably-named strain can go a long way, even for more experienced cannabis consumers.Panda OG also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can lessen the severity of many kinds of aches and pains. It may also serve as an appetite stimulant, provoking hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to invasive treatments like chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, Panda OG can be helpful for those suffering from mild to moderate stress and depression, as it can elevate mood and bring about a feeling of presence and mindfulness. This strain’s long-lasting clearheadedness can even help those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus on a single task. Because it can bring about jitters or cause overstimulated minds to race along endlessly, Panda OG is not recommended for those who have a very low tolerance for THC or are prone to panic.Grow Op Farms has not released seeds of this strain for commercial sale. As such, growers seeking to produce a crop of Panda OG plants will need to obtain clippings from mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is limited information available on ideal conditions for cultivation of Panda OG, like many hybrids, it can be grown either indoors or out -- although successful outdoor growing calls for a warm, semi-humid Mediterranean-like climate. We also know that sativa-dominant hybrids in the Chemdawg family can have a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks and can grow particularly tall during the flowering period. After taking the time to harvest this strain, growers should also properly cure their flowers. Curing involves hanging freshly-cut buds upside down for about a week in surroundings with 50% humidity and a steady 70 degree Fahrenheit temperature. Once buds are sufficiently dry, they should be sealed in airtight jars in surroundings with 70 degree temperatures and about 60-65% humidity.Hybrid fans who prefer a burst of sativa energy that is tempered by a slight body buzz will find what they’re looking for in Panda OG. Its potent, long-lasting effects -- and memorable flavor to boot -- is sure to win repeat customers, even outside Panda OG’s current fan base in the Pacific Northwest.\n"

        "description": "Middlefork (or Middle Fork) is a strain that’s unique not only because of its bold and original flavor, but because it boasts a strong connection to its point of origin. A sativa-leaning cross between DJ Short’s cut of Blueberry and Dutch Treat, Middlefork is named for a fork at the convergence of two rivers in Western Washington state, where it is bred. Created by Royal Tree Gardens, breeders who have given us other tasty strains like Grape Royale and Black Cherry Soda, Middlefork delivers a balanced and enduring high. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has clocked Middlefork’s potency at between 16% and 26% THC.Middlefork is distinguished by dense, medium to large-sized buds that have a tapered, almost conical appearance. The leaves appear pale green, set off by hairy pistils that are orange to brown in color.  Cured buds are absolutely covered in crystalline trichomes -- both on outer surfaces and inner crevices -- giving them a sticky texture and a slight white sheen. On first inspection, Middlefork has a fruity aroma that combines the tart sweetness of Blueberry with the citrus notes of Dutch Treat. Some say that parent strain Dutch Treat is descended from staple Haze, and Middlefork’s scent seems to corroborate this, as breaking open its buds yields the herbal and spicy notes of damp earth so often associated with Haze. When combusted, Middlefork gives off smoke that is smooth and easy on the lungs, but has a notably sour funk. This strain leaves behind a slight citrus tang after being exhaled.Middlefork has a high that takes hold quickly in the form of a bracing headrush. Smokers may find themselves suddenly more alert and attuned to their surroundings. A smile soon creeps its way into the smoker’s heavy, tingling face as Middlefork confers feelings of warmth and euphoria. This optimism and mental stimulation easily lends itself to creative projects as well as mundane errands, providing a quick burst of energy. As the high wears on, an indica body stone creeps in, pulverizing muscle tension and allowing users to breathe more easily and deeply. Although Middlefork may not necessarily lead to couchlock, the sedation on this strain’s backend goes some way toward undoing its initially cerebral effects. As the high tapers off, smokers may find themselves more dopey and dreamy than focused and exacting. This strain’s effects can linger up to four hours, proving potent even for cannabis veterans. Its wide-ranging effects can be enjoyed at almost any time of day.Just as it is a recreationally versatile strain, Middlefork also has many benefits for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily numb the intense symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also soothe aches and pains, ranging from the mild to the chronic and severe. In high enough doses, Middlefork may also relieve stubborn cases of insomnia (although insomnia patients should be prepared to endure some cerebral mindfulness before the strain’s heavy sedation kicks in). This strain is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance, as its thought-provoking effects may trigger a feeling of “mindrace” or recursive thinking.Breeders Royal Tree Gardens have not made seeds of Middlefork available for purchase online. As such, those seeking to grow this strain must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical clones. Middlefork can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires semi-humid climates with steady daytime sunlight and temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. There is limited information available on best cultivation practices for this strain. However, Middlefork is known to be a very pungent plant with an overly sweet funk, somewhat akin to rotting fruit or vegetables; growers looking to keep their indoor operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Middlefork’s buzzy energy is great for parties and small gatherings of friends, where it can sustain stimulating conversation. It also provides the perfect setting for kicking back at home with a psychedelic movie or show. Any smokers looking to take advantage of Middlefork’s early sativa rush should get any ambitious tasks out of the way quickly, before this strain’s sleepy indica side takes over.\n"

It is a cross between perennial favorite Dutch Treat and a fruity Hawaiian landrace. This is one taste-engineered strain that doesn’t sacrifice potency for flavor -- its dynamic tropical character is complemented by a steady, mellow head high that can enhance any number of situations. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Dutch Hawaiian’s THC content at between 15% and 25%.Dutch Hawaiian has medium-sized flowers that cling together in tapered, spade-like shapes. The flowers hold a loose, sativa-typical bud structure that gives the leaves a somewhat ragged appearance and a fluffy texture. Leaves themselves are a bright shade of spring green and are shot through with hairy yellow and orange pistils. A film of cloudy white trichomes gives the flowers a slight sheen and makes them particularly sticky and difficult to break up by hand.Dutch Hawaiian’s aroma is where its bag appeal becomes obvious. Parent strain Hawaiian’s influence is clear in this strain’s tropical, orange-tinged scent. Breaking open the loose flowers yields some herbal notes as well, reminiscent of Haze or Jack Herer. When combusted, Dutch Hawaiian burns with a very smooth and rich smoke. On the exhale, a distinct pineapple flavor shines through, followed by a bit of a musky, hashy aftertaste that lingers on the palate. Enjoy this robust, tasty strain in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe to appreciate the full subtlety of its flavor.Dutch Hawaiian has a high that mounts slowly, often taking several minutes before mits effects are fully felt. Smokers will eventually detect a feeling of sharpened perception, with certain colors and sounds seeming more dynamic or intense. Smokers may also notice themselves ascending into a more cerebral mindset; fleeting thoughts or impressions may take on a new significance. Dutch Hawaiian also comes with a grounding sense of physical relaxation that tempers the intensity of this cerebral experience. As the high wears on, those who enjoy this strain will find themselves more physically at ease and thus more able to maintain concentration and productivity if they so desire; couchlock is not commonly reported. Dutch Hawaiian can also be a remarkably social strain, maintaining outgoing vibes band keeping conversation flowing. This strain can be potent and long-lasting, even for more experienced cannabis consumers. A great choice for waking-and-baking, Dutch Hawaiian may even be good for nighttime reflection and introspection -- but be wary that the strain’s thought-provoking tendencies may intensify as greater amounts are consumed.Dutch Hawaiian may also have value for medical cannabis patients. It can numb troublesome aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. It can also take the edge off of daily stresses for those suffering from mild to moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD. Its lucid focus may even be of use for patients with attention deficit disorders. Negative side effects include persistent dry eyes and dry mouth. Those who are prone to panic or acute anxiety may want to think twice before sampling this strain, as its sativa onset may create a sense of “mindrace” in which the user can feel temporarily out of control of their thoughts or feelings.Breeders Top Shelf have not made seeds of Dutch Hawaiian available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Dutch Hawaiian can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires humid, sunny climates such as those found in the Mediterranean or, appropriately enough, Hawaii. That said, this strain’s hardy sativa genes make it somewhat more resistant to variables like excessive moisture and temperature variations. Dutch Hawaiian’s flowering nodes produce large, chunky calyxes that may require artificial staked supports to keep them from drooping on overburdened branches. Growers should also take the time to properly cure their harvested flowers in order to maintain this strain’s unique flavor.Dutch Hawaiian’s very name encapsulates the advantages of international collaboration in cannabis breeding. With vibrant, landrace-derived flavor and sturdy sativa genes, Dutch Hawaiian is perfectly suited for sharing at parties and other small gatherings. Its standout aroma is sure to gain some gratitude and spark some new conversations.\n"

        "description": "Lodi Dodi is a mysterious, sativa-dominant hybrid with a uniquely sweet flavor and well-balanced, therapeutic high. It is the creation of Smokey Point Productions, a group of Washington state-based breeders who supply area dispensaries with strains like Dirty Girl. Although Lodi Dodi’s genetics are kept proprietary by Smokey Point, it is known to impart a creative, thoughtful high. This strain’s name may be a reference to the 1993 Snoop Dogg single Lodi Dodi (which itself may refer to the Central Californian city of Lodi). Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Lodi Dodi’s potency at between 13% and a staggering 28% THC.Flowers of Lodi Dodi are marked by small to medium-sized nuggets of moss green flowers threaded through with rust-colored pistils. Their loose bud structure is more sativa than indica, with soft and fluffy leaves tearing relatively easily off of their central stems. A high volume of trichomes covers the flowers, giving them a white sheen and making them hard to break up without the user of a grinder. When properly cured, Lodi Dodi’s flowers have a distinctly tropical aroma, redolent of pineapple, melons, and flowers. Notes of rich pine are evident as well. Breaking open or grinding the buds gives off some chemical, Diesel-like notes. When combusted, this strain gives off a harsh smoke that may sting the sinuses and induce coughing. On the exhale, Lodi Dodi has a dynamically sweet taste with hints of honey and undercut by a skunky, fuel-like tang.Lodi Dodi’s high comes on quickly, making its presence known with a pressure behind the eyes and temples. As they acclimate to this new sensation, users will find that their thoughts flow more easily, often jumping from one to the next. In the right set and setting, this cerebral trip can be a great aid in creative thinking or in analytical problem solving. Lodi Dodi’s thoughtfulness is also accompanied by an easygoing and clearheaded euphoria, allowing for mellow and free-flowing conversation with friends. As the high wears on, a warm feeling of physical relaxation spreads through the core and the limbs, grounding out the initial head high and possibly inspiring smokers to seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. The eventual combination of mental and physical effects makes this strain a great way to enhance activities that involve both mind and body -- including, but not limited to, exercise and sex. Lodi Dodi’s versatility makes it appropriate for use at any time of day, although smokers should be warned that as dosage is increased, so is the likelihood of couchlock.Lodi Dodi’s medical effects are also wide-ranging. It can make aches and pains more bearable, whether they’re temporary, as due to minor injuries, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Anti-inflammatory properties also make this strain an effective analgesic for headaches and stomach pain. Psychologically speaking, Lodi Dodi’s mood-enhancing effects can make the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety more bearable. Its long-term lucidity and focus can also aid concentration for patients with attention deficit disorders.Just as they have kept Lodi Dodi’s genes a secret, Smokey Point has also not released seeds of the strain for commercial sale. As such, those looking to grow this fruity variety will need obtain clippings of a mature, healthy plant in order to grow genetically-identical clones. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. There is limited information available on ideal cultivation of this strain; however, Lodi Dodi’s sativa character, along with its tropical, possibly Hawaiian genetics, implies tall, spindly plants that may need to be pruned and trimmed early on in the vegetative stage in order to keep their height manageable in indoor growing operations. After the long and painstaking growing process is complete, growers should also take the time to properly cure their harvested buds to preserve their flavor and psychoactivity.A hit in a wide variety of settings, this strain’s signature aroma is sure to turn heads at parties. If you’re planning on bringing a joint of Lodi Dodi to enjoy when you’re out with friends, make sure you bring enough for everyone.\n"

        "description": "Head Cheese is a well-balanced hybrid with an unmistakable pungency. Although its namesake -- a meat jelly containing chunks of calf’s or pig’s head -- may not appeal to many, this strain has won plenty of fans for its potent and versatile high. It is a cross between the legendary hybrid 707 Headband and staple strain UK Cheese. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Head Cheese’s psychoactivity at between 13% and a staggering 30% THC.Head Cheese impresses with large, chunky flowers that are broad at the base and taper into a pointed, conical shape. The buds hold a dense, indica-typical structure and the tightly-coiled leaves are a bright shade of spring green, threaded through with hairy yellowish pistils. Translucent amber trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers, giving the leaves a yellow tint. The buds are also very sticky and may be difficult to break up without the use of a high-quality grinder.Although it may be visually impressive, this strain’s aroma can prove divisive. The ripe tang of well-aged cheese wafts off of the flowers. A slightly metallic odor, redolent of pennies, mixes (and, some might say, clashes) with this strong cheese smell. Grinding up or breaking open the buds yields some dank, earthy notes -- not surprising, given that OG Kush features prominently in Head Cheese’s genetics. When burnt, Head Cheese gives off a thick and acrid smoke that may sting sinuses and cause eyes to water. On the exhale, it tastes of cheese with a slight citrus overlay. This strain can be a particularly pungent smoke; those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.Head Cheese has a high that takes hold quickly, hitting users with a headrush that soon gives way to a constricting pressure in the forehead and temples. This head high sharpens the smoker’s senses, making sights and sounds takes on a new intensity. Just as they may be more likely to notice their immediate surroundings, users may also feel more thoughtful and dwell on abstract concepts or previously unremarkable ideas. This cerebral mindset provides the perfect backdrop for creative projects, as it encourages free-flowing inspiration. It can also help users approach problems or questions with innovative, unconventional methods. As the high wears on, an indica body stone creeps up, breaking up any physical tension and helping users to breathe more deeply and easily. Although heavy couchlock is uncommon, Head Cheese’s high has a backend that is more sedative than energetic. As such, this is a strain best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening so that smokers can appreciate the full range of its effects.Just as recreational users can appreciate both the mental and physical effects of Head Cheese, the strain also has wide-ranging applications for medical cannabis patients. Its thought-provoking, mood-altering effects can be a balm for the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, it can numb deep-seated aches and pains. Anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe everyday problems from nausea to headaches and migraines. Because of the freely-associative mindrace associated with the strain’s early onset, it is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Multiple commercial breeders have made seeds of Head Cheese available for purchase online. A moderately difficult grow, it can be cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. When grown indoors, its short and bushy plants can be easily managed by “topping,” or trimming any broad fan leaves in order to encourage air and light circulation among the lower branches. Head Cheese flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in October when grown outdoors. Head Cheese is also known to be a very high yielder, offering up as much as 69 grams (or about 2.4 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Though its mish-mash of bold flavors may be an acquired taste, Head Cheese scores high marks for its long-lasting and well-balanced effects. It can be enjoyed while out with friends or simply as a way to unwind alone after a day of work.\n"

        "description": "Southern African nation Malawi is one of the most prolific grower of cannabis in its region. Primarily produced for (illegal) export, Malawi’s indigenous sativa strain -- known eponymously as Malawi, and sometimes Malawi Gold -- is prized internationally for its complex flavor profile and its strong, intensely cerebral high. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has tested multiple samples of Malawi and found them to have a potency ranging from 14% to 24% THC.Those familiar with the wispy, elongated buds characteristic of indigenous Thai sativas (sometimes known as Thai stick) will see a similar silhouette in Malawi’s flowers. The mossy green leaves are long and tapered, in contrast to the short and tightly-coiled leaves often seen in indica varieties and crossbreeds. These leaves cling together in a ragged, fluffy-looking bud structure and are easily torn away from their central stems. A high volume of trichomes also makes Malawi very sticky and difficult to break up without the use of a quality grinder. Malawi’s flowers give off a very sweet, almost candy-like smell, tinged with some berry fruitiness. The subtle aroma of coffee beans is also at play, lending a nutty and toasty character to the bouquet. A subtle lemon scent rounds out this strain’s odor and becomes even more prevalent on the exhale. When combusted, Malawi burns with a smooth and lung-expanding smoke.Malawi’s high takes hold almost immediately, providing a burst of social energy and sharpening smokers’ senses. All surroundings and stimuli, however mundane, suddenly become interesting and dynamic on their own merits. Malawi’s power to provoke thoughtfulness isn’t entirely analytical, though -- smokers have a more hazy and dreamlike mood while exercising their enhanced powers of perception. Visual and auditory distortions are also commonly reported, adding to this strain’s psychedelic nature. Malawi’s easygoing and somewhat mystical high is particularly well-suited to spending time outdoors; many fans of the strain describe enjoying it on a hike, at the beach, or simply as a supplement to an idle stroll. Malawi can also inspire creativity, giving users the energy to work on innovative projects. Almost totally devoid of the physically relaxing effects that come with indica strains, Malawi is much more likely to keep users wired and energetic than lazy and couch locked. This high is long-lasting even for more experienced cannabis users and is best enjoyed during the day. Finally, as with any strain, the smoker’s set and setting can have a great impact on their experiences; as such, those planning to enjoy Malawi may want to curate their surroundings for optimal mellow vibes.Malawi’s mental effects can have some psychological benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its euphoria and energy can help those with mild to moderate cases of stress and depression to temporarily let go of tensions and live more deliberately “in the moment.” Its sustained sense of focus can also help patients with attention deficit disorders to work consistently on single tasks. Because of its cerebral intensity, Malawi may prove overwhelming for smokers who have a low THC tolerance or are prone to panic or anxiety.Prospective growers can purchase seeds of Malawi from producers like ACE Seeds. The strain has strong landrace genetics, fine-tuned over generations of deliberate breeding in the country’s high elevations and tropical climate. As a result, it is an especially durable and resilient grow: the plants are naturally resistant to mold and mildew, as well as to temperature variations. Although native to Southern Africa, Malawi can be successfully cultivated in regions as far north as New England. Plants grow very tall and may require pruning or trimming to fit inside indoor spaces. This sativa takes an incredibly long time to reach maturity, flowering anywhere between 11 and 14 weeks when grown indoors and ready for harvest in early November when grown outdoors.Malawi may be somewhat difficult to come by, depending on your region. Although popular in American dispensaries in the Pacific Northwest, it is not regularly stocked further east. Seasoned smokers looking for a strong, long-lasting, and potentially spiritual experience should jump at the chance to sample this storied strain. Malawi’s stability has made it valuable in crossbreeding -- it has been used to create strains like Golden Tiger.\n"

        "description": "Laughing Buddha is a buzzy, thought-provoking strain with very strong landrace genetics. It is a cross between sativas that are indigenous to Jamaica and Thailand -- and in fact, it may be named for its Thai roots, as Thailand is a historical center of Theravada Buddhism. Laughing Buddha has a dank, citrus taste and energizing effects. It was created by Dutch breeders Barney’s Farm, the same group responsible for taste-focused strains like Tangerine Dream and Blue Cheese. The strain’s potency earned it Third Place in the 2003 High Times Cannabis Cup.Cannabis enthusiasts familiar with the uniquely spindly, tapered bud structure of Jamaican and Thai will see the influence of these strains in flowers of Laughing Buddha. The large blossoms are more elongated than spherical. Leaves are a dull shade of yellow-green and have a relatively fluffy, ragged texture. Cloudy white trichomes cover the buds, giving them an icy appearance. The predominant aroma of Laughing Buddha is vaguely tropical, with notes of citrus and herbs. There’s also a toasted, nutty character that rounds out these scents and keeps them from smelling too fruity or acidic. Breaking open or grindings the flowers yields a spicy and peppery odor. When combusted, Laughing Buddha burns with a smooth, rich smoke. On the exhale, this smoke has a skunky lemon flavor with some herbal highlights.The high from Laughing Buddha takes hold quickly, manifesting as a pressure around the eyes and temples. Smokers may be initially caught off balance by feelings of altered perception, attaching their attention to all kinds of external stimuli. Sights and sounds can take on a new intensity, and visual distortions are commonly reported. As this new sensation becomes more familiar, users notice that their tensions and stresses have dissipated and given way to a giddy, euphoric mood. These friendly, positive vibes are right at home in social settings, where Laughing Buddha can facilitate interesting and free-flowing conversation. As the high wears on, an indica-inflected body high creeps in, making smokers more physically  relaxed -- but by no means incapacitating them. Because it can encourage productivity and relaxation in equal measure, Laughing Buddha is a great strain to enjoy either during the day or later on in the evening.Medically speaking, Laughing Buddha has a few psychological applications. Its mood-altering effects can provide temporarily relief from the distracting symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, helping patients to spend their time more mindfully and deliberately. This strain’s sense of sustained focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrated their mental energy on a single task. Because it lacks the cerebral intensity of other sativas -- like parent strain Jamaica, which is known to be especially powerful in this regard -- Laughing Buddha may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Breeders Barneys Farm sell seeds of Laughing Buddha directly through their website. It is considered a difficult grow, and may not be the best choice for newcomers to cultivation. This strain can be grown indoors or outdoor, although its landrace roots should give you some hint as to its ideal climate; it is best cultivated in a humid, tropical region with consistent daytime sunlight. If grown indoors, its characteristically sativa height will need to be either accommodated by the grow space or kept in check by regular pruning and trimming early in the vegetative stage. Because it is an entirely pure sativa, Laughing Buddha has a very long flowering time of 11 to 12 weeks when grown indoors; it is ready for harvest at the end of October when grown outdoors. As this strain flowers, growers may want to bolster the plant’s tall stalks with stakes or other supports in order to keep them from drooping under the weight of large buds and colas. This strain offers growers a high output for their efforts, yielding about 56 grams (or 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.With thoughtful but not overwhelming cerebral effects, Laughing Buddha is a great option for those seeking a calm, middle-of-the-road sativa. It is enjoyable whether you’re hanging out with friends or just lounging solo at home. Laughing Buddha is also the perfect way to enhance a hike or a camping trip.\n"

        "description": "Headbanger is a hybrid crossed from Biker Kush and sativa favorite Sour Diesel. It was created by Karma Genetics, the same breeders responsible for award-winning strains like Dominator and Happy Kush. So named for its genetic similarity to the legendary strain Headband, Headbanger offers users a strong, clearheaded high and a robust OG flavor. Its potency won it the title of Third Best Sativa in the 2013 High Times Cannabis Cup and Second Best Sativa in the 2015 IC 420 Growers Cup in Amsterdam. Its THC content has been measured at between 20% and 28%.Headbanger has small to medium-sized flowers that cling together in dense, popcorn-like clusters. This strain’s Kush genetics are plainly seen in its thick, solid buds, composed of resinous, densely-packed leaves. These curly leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are threaded through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. The flowers are dusted with milky-white trichomes, accounting for Headbanger’s psychoactivity and giving a very sticky texture. Sour Diesel’s lineage is immediately apparent as a faintly chemical, fuel-like tang that emanates from the cured flowers. This diesel smell mixes with a sharp, skunky odor. Grinding up or breaking the buds yields notes of sweet citrus. Headbanger burns with a smoke that is surprisingly smooth, considering its hashy flavor profile. On the exhale, this strain has the sour-sweet taste of overripe fruit. Anyone smoking in public should keep in mind that this is a particularly pungent variety; those concerned with discretion should take any necessary precautions.Headbanger has a “creeper” of a high, often taking several minutes after smokers have savored its rich taste before taking effect. Users may become gradually more perceptive of their surroundings, with sights and sounds beginning to seem sharper. Eventually, a more cerebral mindset takes over, triggering freely-associative thoughts and conversations. Users looking to accomplish creative or analytical work can benefit from the surge of energy that this strain provides. When combined with trippy, atmospheric music or other stimuli, it can take on powerfully psychedelic dimensions. Headbanger can even help everyday tasks like laundry or cleaning seem more bearable. Heavy physical effects are not commonly reported and users rarely feel drowsy or couch locked. Headbanger is therefore best suited for daytime use; its buzzy head rush is not well-suited to bedtime. The high is said to be long-lasting even for more seasoned cannabis smokers.Because its recreational effects are primarily mental, Headbanger’s medical applications are more psychological than physiological. Its mood-boosting effects can temporarily help those with mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Headbanger’s enduring sense of lucidity may also help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on single tasks. Because initial effects can lead to an overwhelming sense of “mind race,” Headbanger is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Producers Karma Genetics has made seeds of Headbanger available for sale online. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a humid, Mediterranean-like climate with daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Grown indoors, its tall plants (which can reach heights of 6 feet) should be kept under control by regular pruning and trimming early in the vegetative stage. As is typical of sativas, Headbanger has a very long flowering time of 10 to 12 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest from late September through early October when grown outdoors. It offers growers a high yield for their efforts. Finally, Headbanger is as pungent when grown as it is when smoked; growers who are looking to keep their operations under the radar should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Growers should also take the time to cure their harvested flowers to preserve their potency and unique flavor, first hanging and drying the buds for a week and then sealing them in airtight jars, checking regularly for mold.The epitome of a wake-and-bake strain, Headbanger is a great way to enhance productivity, accompany a long walk outdoors, or set the tone for a social gathering. Its high resin production may also be valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Dream Star is a sativa-leaning hybrid that reveals its multi-faceted effects over time. This unique strain was created by the California-based Oaksterdam Seed Company as a cross between the uber-popular Blue Dream and hybrid Stardawg. It has a very unusual flavor profile, with strong notes of earth and coffee. Multiple cannabis testing labs have measured samples of Dream Star and found them to have THC levels from 16% to 25%.Dream Star sets itself apart with massive, chunky buds that hold the elongated, almost cylindrical shape characteristic of sativa-dominant varieties. The forest green leaves carry relatively few hairy pistils and have a fluffy, ragged-looking text, in contrast to the dense, tightly-coiled leaves of indica buds. Flowers of Dream Star have a dank, almost rotting smell with a powerful underlying sweetness, leaving the overall impression of vinegar. Grinding up or breaking open the long buds gives off a slight ammonia tang, evidence of the Chemdawg in this strain’s genetics. When combusted, Dream Star burns with a very smooth smoke. On the exhale, this smoke carries the surprisingly creamy taste of coffee and cocoa, mixed with some woodsy, piney funk.Dream Star has a bracing high that takes hold quickly, manifesting as a pressure around the eyes and temples. These effects are accompanied by a kind of hyper-awareness of the smoker’s surroundings. Such a distorted perception of external stimuli may be disorienting for some. In the right set and setting, though, this cerebral high is matched by a powerful uplift in mood. These mental effects can approach euphoria for some. As the high wears on, Dream Star’s psychedelic characteristics gives way to a tingling relaxation that spreads from the neck down through the torso, and finally to the limbs and extremities. The smoker’s mental faculties may remain intact and they may still be able to maintain conversation and complete some creative or analytical work. However, Dream Star eventually leads to couch-lock, rendering its fans happily immobilized. Many smokers note that, despite its potency, Dream Star is blessedly absent of any groggy and unpleasant “comedown” as its high wears off. This strain’s wide-reaching effects can be enjoyed at any time of day. Try toking before a hike to enjoy maximum sensory stimulation; as Dream Star’s indica side kicks in, you can slow down your pace and set up camp or lay out a gluttonous picnic.Dream Star also has some applications for medical cannabis patients. Its balanced mental and physical effects may be of use to those with stress, depression, and anxiety, as it can eliminate stressors and encourage mindfulness and deliberate action. This strain can also help patients with attention deficit disorders to maintain lucid focus on a single task. The sedative properties that creep in on Dream Star’s backend can dull troubling aches and pains. In large enough doses, the strain can even act against stubborn cases of insomnia, lulling smokers into a deep and refreshing sleep. Because of its initial cerebral effects, Dream Star may not be the best strain for cannabis newcomers, or for patients who are particularly prone to panic.Seeds of this strain have not been mass-produced for commercial sale. As such, those looking to grow Dream Star should obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Once obtained, Dream Star can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. Dream Star flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors; as it blossoms, growers should be sure to support the plants’ branches with stakes or other supports in order to keep them from drooping under the weight of the long, chunky flowers. Growers should also take the time to cure their harvested flowers, first hanging and drying the buds for a week and then sealing them in airtight jars, checking regularly for mold.Dream Star is yet another example of the genetic bounty that powerhouse Blue Dream has to offer. Dream Star has even made a name for itself in the breeding market: backcrossed with Blue Dream, it has yielded the potent Double Dream.\n"

        "description": "Citrix is a sativa-leaning hybrid that imparts dynamic citrus flavor alongside a productive but not overpowering high. Created by Reserva Privada -- the Colorado breeders who have stabilized classics like Headband and Strawberry Banana --  is a cross between Grapefruit and pure indica L.A. Confidential. The strain’s mostly balanced effects make it the perfect accompaniment for adventurous outdoor activities or simply for lounging around at home. Citrix has an average THC content of about 20%.Flowers of Citrix are visually unremarkable. They adhere in a dense, tightly-packed bud structure, typical of predominantly indica varieties. Tightly-curled leaves appear pale spring green and are threaded through with rust-colored pistils. As with parent strain L.A. Confidential, trichomes blanket the nuggets, giving them a very sticky texture and making them difficult to break up by hand. When properly cured, the flowers burst with citrus aroma -- there are notes of fresh orange peel along with an underlying tartness, courtesy of parent strain Grapefruit Notably, this strain has little to none of the hashy, skunky notes usually present in mostly indica strains. When combusted, Citrix burns with a smooth, even smoke and tastes like a tropical melange of orange, pineapple, and grapefruit on the exhale, with just a hint of pine. Sample this strain out of a freshly-cleaned apparatus like a bubble in order to taste its full bouquet.Citrix has a high that doesn’t hesitate to make itself known. Initial effects are observable as a soaring euphoria and a boost in energy levels. As users adjust to these mood-altering effects, they may feel giddy if they find themselves in social situations. Alternatively, they may find the motivation needed to accomplish a long list of tasks and responsibilities. Buzzy cerebral effects are also evident, and may help users to exert some creative or analytical brain power. Some indica relaxation creeps in as the high wears on, but these physical effects are more mellowing than incapacitating. The eventual synthesis of therapeutic mental and physical effects makes Citrix a great way to enhance activities that involve both body and mind -- including, but not limited to, video games, exercise, and sex. Even longtime cannabis smokers have testified to Citrix’s potency and long-lasting effects. Citrix also has medical applications, primarily for mental health patients. The strain’s mood-boosting effects can help temporarily alleviate mild to moderate stress and depression, clearing away distractions and helping them to live more fully “in the moment.” It may also be a boon for those with attention deficit disorders, allowing them to maintain lucid focus on a single task. Finally, Citrix’s low-grade physical sedation can counteract acute aches and pains. Even though it’s a sativa, Citrix’ cerebral stimulation is mild enough to make the strain appropriate for those prone to panic or those with low THC tolerances.Reserva Privada has not yet made seeds of Citrix available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Citrix is known to be a particularly hardy grow -- its genes are naturally resistant to disease and mold. This strain can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor rowing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. This strain flowers within 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.After taking the trouble to grow Citrix, growers should also properly cure their flowers to preserve taste and psychoactivity. Curing involves first hanging buds upside down by the stem for 7 to 10 days; the surrounding humidity should be 50% and the temperature about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems snap off of the flowers easily, buds can then be sealed in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and a temperature around 70 degrees. As they cure in the jars, the buds should be checked at least daily for a week for signs of mold.Citrix has all the gregarious social vibes needed to spur on stimulating conversation at a party. If you do bring Citrix to a gathering, be sure to bring enough bud to share, as the strain’s uniquely tangy flavor profile is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.\n"

        "description": "Oh my darlin’, oh my darlin’, Clementine is a sativa-leaning hybrid with uniquely mellow effects.Created by Crockett Family Farms, the same collective who gave us Chocolope, Clementine stimulates unconventional thinking, tempered out by a subtle body high. It is a potent combination of Tangie and Lemon Skunk that boasts citrus, pine, and diesel scents. A concentrated wax preparation of Clementine won the title of Second Best Sativa concentrate in the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured samples of Clementine to have as much as 27% THC.Clementine is distinguished by impressively large flowers that taper down from their bases into pointed, almost conical buds. The elongated flowers have a characteristically sativa bud structure, in which the thin and fluffy leaves cling loosely to their central stems. Leaves themselves are a yellowish green and are threaded through with brown pistils. Cloudy, translucent trichomes give these buds a slightly white tint and make them very difficult to break up without the use of a grinder. When properly cured, flowers of Clementine have a sweet citrus aroma. Lemon and orange notes blend with the rich scent of pine. Breaking open or grinding the buds yields more of a diesel odor. Clementine burns with a smooth, lung-expanding smoke. On the exhale, this smoke leaves behind the faintly chemical taste of lemon-scented cleaning products. Although it doesn’t have much of a hashy, skunky smell, Clementine stills emits a certain  pungency when burnt; as such, smokers trying to remain discreet should take the necessary precautions.Clementine’s high takes hold quickly, although it doesn’t have the cerebral intensity that comes with some other sativas. Rather, smokers may feel more perceptive and attuned to their surroundings. As they taper down from the peak of the high, smokers may also find themselves attaching their attention to abstract concepts and engaging in creative thinking and problem solving. Clementine also works with more mundane activities like running errands or cleaning the house. A slight sense of physical relaxation and decreased tension can pull users down to earth in the event that they’re overpowered by recursive, cerebral thinking. A classic wake-and-bake strain, Clementine may not be the best flower to smoke just before bedtime, as it can leave users alert or overstimulated. Clementine can also offer some psychological benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its powerful mood enhancement may ease the symptoms of stress and depression, helping smokers to exercise their energy more mindfully and deliberately. Its clearheaded capacity for focus can also be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders. Because initial cerebral effects come about quickly, Clementine may not be a great choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have lower than average THC tolerance.Clementine’s creators Crockett Family Farms have released seeds of the strain for commercial sale. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants can grow tall, especially during the flowering stage; growers should attempt to keep this height manageable through regular pruning and trimming. This strain has an unusually short flowering time for a sativa, at 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Growers can expect Clementine to yield as much as 46 to 55 grams (or 1.6 to 1.9 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Just as this strain can be a pungent smoke, it can also be a very smelly grow -- those growing indoors may want to invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Grow should also properly cure their flowers to preserve Clementine’s unique citrus flavor. Curing involves first hanging buds upside down by the stem for about a week in conditions with 50% humidity and 70 degree temperatures. Once stems snap off of the flowers easily, buds can then be sealed in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and a temperature of around 70 degrees. While they cure, the buds should be checked at least daily for a week for signs of mold.With bold flavors and an enduring, thoughtful high, Clementine proves that that taste doesn’t have to come at the expense of psychoactivity. Enjoyable in both solo or social settings, Clementine is a great option for sativa fans who may be looking for something a little more mild than usual.\n"

        "description": "Crown Royal is an indica-dominant hybrid that blends two colorful and fruity strains: it is a cross between Blueberry and Purple Kush, both indicas themselves. Not to be confused with the Canadian blended whiskey of a similar name, Crown Royale is a tasty and potent strain with impressive landrace genes -- its grandparent strains include landrace varietals from Thailand, Afghanistan, and the Hindu Kush. This strain’s potency has been tested at between a modest 12% and an impressive 22%.Flowers of Crown Royale are marked by their large, solid appearance. The chunky and spherical buds have a typical indica structure, with resinous and tightly-packed nuggets. The curly, coiled leaves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are set off by a high volume of hairy orange pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain are also shot through with streaks of deep blue and purple -- these eye-catching colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins (passed on from both parent strains) which, when agitated by cold weather in the growing process, expose violet shades lurking underneath the more conventional green leaves. The influence of blueberry is obvious in Crown Royale’s predominantly tart and fruity aroma. There’s also a pleasant floral, herbal character that brightens up these tart scents. Breaking up or grinding the flowers gives off some spicy, peppery notes as well. When combusted, the strain burns with a rich, lung-expanding smoke that, despite its heaviness, will not necessarily induce coughing. On the exhale, Crown Royale leaves a pleasant, grape-tinged taste that lingers on the palate. Notably, this grape flavor is totally incidental to the flowers’ purple hues: the pigments that dictates  the leaves’ color do not have a corresponding effect on their scent.Crown Royale can be described as a creeper of strain, often taking several minutes after users have savored its unique taste before its effects fully bloom. Users may notice an initial pressure around the eyes and temples. A subtle tingle then manifests in the neck and spine and gradually spreads out through the core and limbs in waves of relaxation. Although a full body high is this strain’s most obvious effect, the trace amounts of sativa in Crown Royale’s genes also contribute to some mental stimulation. That said, the character of these mental effects is more hazy and dreamy than analytical; users may run into some trouble if they’re expecting to plow through a to-do list with energy and motivation. Instead, Crown Royale can enhance passive aesthetic experiences -- it’s just the thing for visiting a museum or going to a midday movie. Furthermore, this strain’s singularly embodied sensation can be a surprising aphrodisiac. Smokers should prepare for a feeling of body melt that becomes insurmountable as the high wears on. As such, Crown Royale is definitely a strain best enjoyed at night, as its thorough sedation can easily lead to deep and fulfilling sleep.Crown Royale has several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. It can numb the aches and pains associated with both temporary injuries and chronic conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe mild to moderate headaches and nausea. It may provoke hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Finally, as noted, Crown Royale can counteract even stubborn cases of insomnia. Digital retailers Crop King Seeds have made seeds of Crown Royale available for sale online. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a humid, Mediterranean-like climate with daytime temperature in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants have the short and bushy silhouette characteristic of other indicas. Growers should regularly “top” their plants by trimming away any light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage growth among each plant’s low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out this strain’s purple bag appeal should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Crown Royale flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a moderate yield of about 46 grams (or 1.6 ounces) of flower for every square foot of plant.Somewhat difficult to come by, Crown Royale is worth snatching up if you’re looking for an indica that will offer a dreamy, trippy experience while leaving your largely lucid and functional. It’s a great choice for either solo or social enjoyment.\n"

        "description": "Fruit Loops -- not to be confused with Fruity Loops or Fruity Pebbles -- is a flavor-packed indica hybrid that benefits from some very prestigious genetics. It is said to be a four-way cross between Blueberry, Grapefruit, White Widow, and Blue Dream -- all top-shelf strains in their own right, and each passing on distinctive traits to make Fruit Loops a standout. This balanced strain brings about an energizing and thought-stimulating mindset, but an underlying indica body stone keeps it a mellow and easygoing smoke. Fruit Loops’ THC levels have been measured at between 16% and 19%.Fruit Loops is distinguished by large flowers that have an almost spherical shape and adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. The tightly-curled leaves are a deep forest green, threaded through with bright orange pistils. Many phenotypes of the strain also have vibrant shades of purple running through the leaves; as in parent strains Blue Dream and Blueberry, these hues are the result of cold temperatures stimulating anthocyanin pigments during the growing process. Parent strain White Widow also passes on its high resin production: glassy white trichomes cover the already-colorful flowers, giving them a slight sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Fruit Loops hits the nose with the bright tropical aroma of berries and citrus; the double dose of Blueberry is most obvious here. On closer inspection, there’s also a slight hint of skunkiness. Breaking open or grinding the buds yields notes of hash and incense, presumably passed on from grandparent strain Afghani. When combusted, Fruit Loops’ complex mix of terpenes can give off a thick and cough-inducing smoke. On the exhale, though, this smoke tastes sugary-sweet and hangs on the palate with a touch of spice.The high from Fruit Loops takes effect gradually; smokers may need to indulge in a second bowl or puff before they feel a mounting pressure around the eyes and temples. A smile may creep in and eyelids may start to droop as users begin to feel at ease with their surroundings. This physical relaxation, typical of indica-leaning varieties, is soon met by an uptick in thoughtfulness. External stimuli or abstract concepts may strike smokers as more interesting or worthy of discussion than they otherwise might. These buzzy vibes, more rambling than cerebral, can lend themselves to friendly and free-flowing conversation. As smokers enjoy this increased sociability, a mild physical sedation keeps them floating along, as if suspended in a sensory deprivation tank. As the high wears on, or as dosage is increased, Fruit Loops may lead to a palpable sense of body melt, banishing stress and physical pain. Because of its middle-of-the-road effects, Fruit Loops is a great strain to enjoy at any time of day; its mental stimulation is not intense enough to keep users wired as bedtime approaches.Fruit Loops also has various applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sedative effects can be an effective analgesic for aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. Anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, Fruit Loops can temporarily numb the unpleasant symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. In high enough doses, the strain can relieve insomnia, drawing users into a deep and restful sleep. Because it lacks the cerebral “mind race” of some other hybrids, Fruit Loops may be a good strain for patients with panic disorders or with a low tolerance for THC.No major breeders have claimed responsibility for the creation of this tasty and complex strain. As such, seeds are not commercially available and prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical clones. Although there is limited information available for best cultivation practices, we know that Fruit Loops, like many hybrids, can be grown in climate-controlled indoor environments or in warm, semi-humid outdoor environments. Those looking to bring out this strain’s colorful bag appeal should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins.Aside from its long-lasting and crowd-pleasing effects, Fruit Loops’ novelty flavor ensures that it will be a hit at parties. If you bring some out to enjoy with friends, be prepared to share -- its unique aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Stoners of a certain age may associate “Deep Purple” with the 1970s proto-metal band of the same name -- and with the ubiquitous intro guitar riff to their hit Smoke on the Water. Many other cannabis enthusiasts, however, hear Deep Purple and thinking of dense, colorful buds bursting with grape and berry flavor. Deep Purple is a cross between Mendocino Purps-descended, Purple Urkle, and fruity indica Querkle. Created by the prolific breeding collective TGA Subcool Seeds, Deep Purple is a carefully-curated indica that offers mellow and sedative effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytic 360 has found flowers of this strain to have THC levels between 14% and 19%.When burnt, Deep Purple gives off a smooth, rich smoke that tastes like sweet grape and berry. This bud is best enjoyed in a joint or a freshly cleaned pipe so its flavor can shine. The stoney, heavy high creeps up slowly -- within minutes, it will either leave you couch-locked or walking around daydreaming. It’s the perfect choice for evening or nighttime use, and it’s as fun to smoke alone as it is to share. Because it’s so sedative, Deep Purple can also be a great way to treat insomnia.Deep Purple is marked by very large, tapered flowers that adhere in a dense indica bud structure. The bright, almost neon green flowers are threaded through with neon orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. As this strain’s name implies, most phenotypes also boast shades of purple in their leaves, ranging from a pale lavender to a deep violet. These vibrant colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plants’ genes are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process; this interaction is similar in principle to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. Deep Purple’s primary aroma has been described as a combination of grapes and sweet plums. These fruity and refreshing notes are grounded out by the musky and dank scent of freshly-tilled soil. When combusted, Deep Purple burns with a rich, lung-expanding, and surprisingly smooth smoke. On the exhale, it leaves flavors of sugary grape and berry, tinged by some earthy, tobacco-like notes. Notably, this strain’s grape flavor is entirely incidental to its purple appearance: this is because the the flower’s color-determining pigments function independently of the terpenes that dictate the strain’s flavor profile.Deep Purple can be described as a creeper of a strain, with its high mounting in progressively nuanced layers. Initial effects can be detected as a pressure around the eyes and temples. These disorienting sensations are often accompanied by a trippy sativa edge -- auditory stimuli may feel strangely disconnected from their sources; visual distortions are also commonly reported. As smokers adjust to their altered states, Deep Purple melts into an easygoing and lucid relaxation. Although some productivity and creative output is still possible, Deep Purple often discourages mobility or manual labor as it tapers into heavy couch-lock. This strain is perfectly suited to spending a lazy afternoon or evening with friends or to kicking back alone at home alone after a long day of work. Deep Purple’s long-lasting high has been praised by even seasoned cannabis fans.Deep Purple’s sedative effects can also have various applications for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily numb aches and pains, both minor and chronic. Anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe everyday annoyances, from headaches to nausea. Psychologically speaking, Deep Purple can also help those with anxiety, depression, and PTSD by taking the edge off of the more troubling symptoms of these conditions. It may also allow patients with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on simple tasks. Because of the relative lack of buzzy cerebral effects, Deep Purple can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Breeders TGA Subcool have released seeds of Deep Purple for sale online. The strain can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Indoors, the strain’s plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to regularly “top off” these small plants by trimming away any broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Deep Purple has a short flowering time of about 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers a moderate yield at harvest time.A potent indica that only reveals its full sedative potential as the high wears on, Deep Purple is excellent to hoard for solo enjoyment. That said, its dynamic scent and flavor can also be a great way to win over some friends and admirers in more buzzy social situations.\n"

        "description": "Girl Scout Cookies has proven to be one of the most popular strain in the modern cannabis market, yielding multiple crossbreeds and distinct phenotypes. The product of Girl Scout Cookies and perennial favorite Cherry Pie, Cherry Cookies is one hybrid with serious bag appeal. It is a flavor-packed addition to the Cookies lineage, with a crowd-pleasing, fruity taste and well-balanced effects. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of Cherry Cookies to have an average potency of 20% THC.Cherry Cookies catches the eye right away with exceptionally large, solid flowers that have a tapered, spade-like shape. They have a dense, tightly-packed bud structure, so much so that they may be difficult to break up by hand. The tightly-coiled leaves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are threaded through with bright yellow pistils. As with parent strain Cherry Pie, some phenotypes of Cherry Cookies also boast streaks of purple in their leaves; these hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by unusually cold temperatures during the growing process. The colorful flowers are also coated in cloudy white trichomes, accounting for this strain’s strong psychoactivity and very resinous texture.When properly cured, buds of Cherry Cookies burst with a bright cherry aroma and practically beg to be sniffed and inspected over and over. Hanging out underneath are some more musky, Kushy base notes that are evidence of terpenes passed on from grandparent strain OG Kush. Breaking open or grinding the flowers yields some light herbal notes. When combusted, this strain burns remarkable smooth and is easily inhaled. On the exhale, Cherry Cookies tastes sweet and woodsy, leaving an overall impression similar to the taste of cherry-flavored bourbon.Cherry Cookies has a high that comes on quickly. Smokers are almost immediately struck by a feeling of altered perception -- external stimuli can take on new significance and thoughts may flow in a freely-associative way. Visual distortions are also commonly reported, giving Cherry Cookies’ initial effects a rather psychedelic feel. Within short order, the strain’s indica relaxation -- to this point, only slightly discernible -- creeps forward and spreads through the smoker’s core and limbs. A slight heaviness or pressure may emerge in the forehead and around the temples. This even blend of cerebral insight and physical sedation makes Cherry Cookies perfectly suited to introspective activities like listening to music or taking a nature walk. Cherry Cookies can also facilitate stimulating conversation. Because it is neither overly energizing nor overly sedative, this strain is appropriate for use at any time of day.Just as Cherry Cookies has many users for recreational smokers, it also has a variety of potential benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its enduring relaxation can soothe aches and pains, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Anti-inflammatory properties in the strain’s genetics may also relieve anything from headaches to indigestion. Psychologically speaking, this strain’s overall easygoing vibes can temporarily blunt the acute symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Because Cherry Cookies does not typically lead to intense, recursive thinking or paranoia, it is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Breeders Purple Caper Seeds have staked a claim to Cherry Cookies’ creation; they sell seeds at various Northern California dispensaries. Alternatively, those looking to grow this strain can obtain clippings from mature plants in order to foster genetically identical clones. Cherry Cookies can be cultivated indoors or out, although successful outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Those looking to highlight the strain’s standout purple hues should expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Cherry Cookies flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Somewhat difficult to come by, Cherry Cookies is worth snatching up whenever it’s spotted on dispensary shelves. Its smooth and versatile high is great for solo or social use. If you do bring it out to a party, be prepared to share, as its cherry-tinged clouds are sure to turn some heads and start a few conversations.\n"

        "description": "Banana OG is an indica-leaning hybrid with an unusual aroma: when properly cured, flowers of this strain have the subtle scent and flavor of banana. Banana OG is a cross between perennial favorite OG Kush and Banana Kush, which itself is the product of Ghost OG and Skunk Haze. These Kush, Haze, and Skunk genetics intermingle to yield a surprisingly sweet and mild smoke. Besides its standout taste, Banana OG offers a balanced, long-lasting high that’s enjoyable in a wide range of situations. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of this strain to have THC levels ranging from 16% to 25%.Banana OG is distinguished by impressively large, chunky flowers that have a tapered, spade-like shape. The buds maintain a distinctly indica structure, dense and tightly-packed. Leaves are a pale green and play host to a profusion of rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils intended to catch pollen from male plants). Banana OG’s flowers are also covered in amber-colored trichomes that give the leaves a slightly yellow tint.A pleasant tropical odor bursts out of this strain’s flowers, presenting notes of banana with some faint citrus in the background. On closer inspection, there’s also a slight grassy smell hanging out underneath. Breaking open or grinding the buds gives off more of the dank, earthy scents typically associated with Kush varieties. When combusted, this strain can have a harsh and cough-inducing smoke. On the exhale, though, this smoke tastes tropical and is undercut by a hashy, incense-like flavor. Smokers should keep in mind that this is a particularly pungent strain; those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any needed precautions.Banana OG is known to be a creeper of a strain, often taking several minutes before its effects can be fully detected. When the high does arrive, it brings both barrels, acting on the user’s cognition and body all at once. Initial effects can be disorienting and include dizziness, euphoria, and mind race. The smoker’s thoughts may jump from one to the next as they’re simultaneously beset by the sudden desire to sit or lie down. With time, this early intensity tapers off into a holistic relaxation, with both mental and physical effects humming along at a pleasurable pace. Couch-lock is commonly reported, but so is deep, creative thinking -- just don’t expect to find the energy to stand up and speed through tasks or errands. Enjoy Banana OG at night or in the early evening. Smoke it in a joint or out of a freshly-cleaned pipe to savor its unique flavor.Banana OG is also versatile for medical cannabis patients, providing relief from both psychological and physiological problems. It can ease aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic and disease-related. Its uplifting, mood-altering effects can be helpful for mild to moderate cases of stress and depression, helping patients to spend their time more consciously and mindfully. In high enough doses, it can also counteract insomnia, lulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Banana OG may not be the best choice for those prone to panic or anxiety, as its early destabilizing effects can lead to paranoia.Breeders Apothecary Genetics -- also responsible for the flavor-focused strains Grape Ape and Grape Royale -- have made seeds of Banana OG available for sale online. Once obtained, this strain can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Growers should expect their plants to grow short and bushy, and should “top off” the crops by trimming any broad, light-blocking fan leaves that tend to grow at the tops of stalks. Banana OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. It offers growers only a modest yield for their efforts, at about 32 to 37 grams (or 1 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Banana OG is a great example of how flavor doesn’t always come at the expense of potency when it comes to cannabis breeding. This strain’s dynamic knockout effects make it a great choice for un kicking back and getting silly with close friends or lounging and unwinding at home before bed.\n"

This calming, sedative strain is a cross between the rock-solid genetics of Skunk-derived XXX and the notorious OG Kush. XXX OG’s potency and its woodsy flavor profile won the strain the title of Best Indica in the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup. Cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s THC content at between a modest 11% and a solid 21%.XXX OG is immediately set apart from the pack with chunky, medium to large-sized flowers. These flowers are spherical in shape and have the dense and heavy bud structure typical of indica varieties. Leaves are a mossy green and are packed full of orange pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain also exhibit vivid streaks of purple -- these purple hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold weather during the growing process; this mechanism is similar in principle to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. Cloudy white trichomes coat the outer and inner surfaces of the leaves, making them very difficult to break up by hand.The influence of OG Kush in this strain’s aroma, which is more earthy than fruity. Notes of damp earth and pine predominate. Some sharp citrus tang hangs out underneath, brightening up this dank profile. When combusted, this strain gives off a surprisingly smooth smoke for an indica. On the exhale, it leaves a cloyingly sweet and slightly peppery taste that lingers on the palate.XXX OG is a creeper of a strain, often taking several minutes before its effects are fully appreciated. The high starts off as a tingling, detected in the face and down the neck. Within minutes, the smoker’s entire body may seem to pleasantly hum with relaxation. Once adjusted to this novel physical sensation, smokers may feel compelled to recline in the closest comfortable surroundings -- and indeed, you’ll want to be in your home or in a similar comfort zone as XXX OG’s relaxing undertow takes over. This thorough sedation, combined with subtle mental stimulation, can make lounging at home into a psychedelic experience. Sights and sounds can take on an amplified, more dynamic quality. Despite some uptick in thoughtfulness, however, this strain is free of the cerebral mindrace that comes with more sativa-dominant varieties. As dosage is increased, XXX OG can veer into couchlock territory, even lulling users into a deep and fulfilling sleep. For all these reasons, XXX OG is a strain that’s best enjoyed during the evening or before bed.XXX OG is also useful for medical cannabis patients, with both physiological and psychological applications. Its powerful feelings of relaxation can blunt the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate cases of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe chronic aches and pains and ease everyday irritations like headaches and stomach problems. XXX OG may be helpful for older patients, as it can ease the painful intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Finally, as mentioned, XXX OG’s undertow of physical relaxation can be of use to those who suffer from unyielding insomnia.No breeders have made seeds of XXX OG available for commercial sale, although prospective growers can obtain clippings of mature plants from fellow enthusiasts in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Alternatively, retailer Midnight Farms sells XXX OG clones online.Once obtained, this strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70-degree Fahrenheit range. Growers should trim away any broad fan leaves on the short, bushy plants to ensure that light reaches any low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to accentuate XXX OG’s purple streaks should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.XXX OG is well-suited to unwinding at home before bed. Yet despite its sleepy vibe, this can also be a very social strain, facilitating easy, free-flowing conversation among friends. XXX OG’s indica potency has become valuable in crossbreeding: crossed with Tahoe Alien, it has yielded the popular Pacific Northwest strain Moonwalker Kush.\n"

        "description": "Cherry Pie, sometimes known as Cherry Kush, is a popular and potent indica-leaning hybrid. This strain is a cross between flavor-packed indica Grandaddy Purple and strong sativa Durban Poison, and it offers smokers some of the best characteristics of both parent strains. Cherry Pie’s balanced and mind-expanding high is enjoyable in a wide variety of settings. This versatility, along with the strain’s tart and fruity taste, has made it a staple in dispensaries nationwide. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has tested multiple samples of Cherry Pie flower and has found consistently high levels of THC, with an average of about 20%.Cherry Pie’s flowers are small to medium in size and have a bud structure characteristic of other predominantly indica strains. The tightly-curled leaves are densely packed together and threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Leaves appear mostly mossy green, although some phenotypes show off flashes of purple; this latter color is due to high concentrations of pigments in the plant’s genes (passed on from Grandaddy Purple) that highlight colors other than green when they’re stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. The colorful buds are coated in translucent white trichomes, giving the small nugs a silver sheen and a very resinous texture.When Cherry Pie is properly cured, a sweet, rich cherry flavor jumps off of the buds, accented by some light herbal and floral notes. More dank, hashy notes linger underneath and are brought forward when the buds are ground up or broken open. When it’s combusted, Cherry Pie gives off a smooth smoke that’s easily inhaled and on the exhale tastes toasted and biscuity with a hint of sweet fruit. Smokers should keep in mind that this strain can be especially pungent; those concerned with discretion should take any needed precautions.Cherry Pie has a high that mounts slowly, beginning as a progressive feeling of relaxation. At first, smokers may detect a slight pressure in their sinuses. After several minutes, Cherry Pie dissolves tension in the core and limbs and facilitates deep, easy breathing. Users may feel like any mild, short-term worries or stressors have evaporated. This pleasant sensation can be the perfect accompaniment to a morning cup of coffee or an evening cocktail. As the high progresses, this strain’s sativa side emerges, working on the user’s perceptions. Visual or auditory stimuli can take on new intensity, and otherwise mundane thoughts may seem markedly more interesting. This is not to say that Cherry Pie easily veers into paranoid, overly cerebral territory, though. The strain’s relaxing indica foundation allows most smokers to coast through the trip while encouraging creative and analytical work. Because it works on both the body and mind, Cherry Pie is good for activities that involve both, like video games and exercise. In the right setting, it can also be a powerful aphrodisiac.For medical cannabis patients, Cherry Pie has both psychological and physiological applications. It can help those plagued by anxiety, depression, and PTSD to spend their time more presently and mindfully. Its unique combination of mental acuity and physical relaxation can also benefit those with attention deficit disorders to devote great concentration to single tasks. Anti-inflammatory properties can soothe anything from  headaches to chronic, disease-related aches and pains. In enough enough doses, Cherry Pie’s sedative tendencies can also relieve insomnia.Although Cherry Pie’s provenance is murky and no high-profile breeders claim to have originated the strain, several producers have made its seeds available for sale online. It can be grown in or outdoors, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a warm, humid, Mediterranean-like climate with consistent daytime sunlight. Plants grow short and bushy with wide lateral branching. Growers may need to periodically trim away any light-blocking fan leaves in order to maximize the growth of any low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out this strain’s eye-catching purple bag appeal should also expose the plants to colder-than-average temperatures during the growing process. Cherry Pie flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors.With a potent high that manages to leave users fully functional, Cherry Pie has secured a household name among well-balanced hybrids. It’s as enjoyable out with friends as it is on a slow night at home.\n"

        "description": "Although it sounds like it could be a dramatic new celebrity fragrance, Rare Darkness is actually an indica-dominant hybrid prized for its flavor and its relaxing, enduring body high. Somewhat confusingly, Rare Darkness is the creation of breeders Rare Dankness. It is a cross between fruity favorite Grape Ape and (you guessed it) a Rare Dankness flagship strain, Rare Dankness #1. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s potency at between 19% and 26% THC.Flowers of Rare Dankness tend to be on the smaller side. The tightly-curled leaves adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. Leaves themselves are a mossy green, shot through with shades of vivid purple. These latter colors are the result of an organic chemical change brought about by the stimulation of anthocyanin pigments by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. The strain’s already-colorful flowers are also dotted with milky white trichomes, accounting for Rare Dankness’ potency and super-sticky texture.Inspecting the buds, users will pick up on a fruity aroma with traces of tart berry. Some musky grape notes are also at play. Grinding up or breaking open the flowers gives off some earthy and faintly skunky odors, possibly passed on from legendary grandparent strains Afghani and Skunk #1. Notably, Rare Dankness’ subtle grape flavor is incidental to its purple hues: while the colors of this strain’s leaves are determined by the aforementioned pigments, its taste is determined by chemical compounds called terpenes. The smoke generated by the strain is thick and lung-expanding and can be harsh, inducing coughing. On the exhale, Rare Dankness tastes like sweet grape tinged with some peppery spice. Smokers should note that this can be an especially pungent variety when combusted; those trying to keep their consumption discreet should take necessary precautions.Rare Dankness asserts itself quickly, exerting a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples before any coughing fits have even ended. Within very little time, users feel more thoroughly relaxed and relieved of any lingering tension. Deep breathing may come more easily, as any contracted muscles begin to relax. Any cognitive effects from this strain manifest as hazy and dreamy thought association; this is more of a strain for daydreaming than for logically thinking through issues or problems. Even after one bowl, smokers report sensations of couch-lock and body melt. As dosage is increased, Rare Dankness may slowly and gently pull you into a deep sleep. It should go without saying, then, that this heavy hitter is best enjoyed at nighttime -- or at least during a particularly passive, lazy day.Rare Dankness’ sedative effects have some clear benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Psychologically speaking, it can help with the acute symptoms of anxiety, depression and PSTD. It can also dull aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to exercise or injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia. As noted, this strain can bring about sleep in the right circumstances, making it a good antidote to stubborn cases of insomnia. Because of its lack of overly cerebral sativa effects, Rare Dankness comes with a lower than average risk of paranoia, making it a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Breeders Rare Dankness have made seeds of Rare Darkness available for sale online. Alternatively, prospective growers can obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Rare Darkness’ plants grow short and bushy and are easily accommodated in indoor grow operations. Growers looking to bring out the full potential of this strain’s eye-catching purple hues should expose plants to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Flowering happens within a relatively long 9 to 10 weeks when this strain is grown indoors. It offers growers a moderate yield for their efforts.A tasty treat to enjoy after dark, Rare Darkness is an excellent choice for unwinding at home after a long day of work. It can also enhance mood and conversation in social situations -- but be prepared to share, as any bystanders may want to sample this flower once they catch a whiff of its spicy and fruity bouquet.\n"

        "description": "Starfighter is a well-balanced hybrid originally created by breeders Alien Genetics. It is a cross between two of Alien Genetics’ other signature crossbreeds: Tahoe Alien and Lemon Alien Dawg. Hybrid devotees will be pleased by this strain’s high, which is powerfully uplifting and invigorating without making smokers jittery. Starfighter is a versatile strain that deserves a spot in any smoker’s artillery. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Starfighter to have an average THC content of about 20%.Starfighter is marked by medium-sized flowers that hold a dense, tightly-packed bud structure. Its leaves range in color from pale to dark forest green and are threaded through with rust-colored pistils. Tinges of purple also emerge in certain phenotypes, the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. The buds are flecked by white -- and in some phenotypes, amber -- trichomes that give the flowers a resinous texture even after they’re dried and cured.The rich, unmistakable aroma of pine wafts up from the eye-catching buds, giving them even greater bag appeal. This woodsy scent is punctuated by a sharp chemical tang, leaving the overall impression of a pine-scented cleaning product. Grinding up or breaking the nugs yields notes of hash and incense, no surprise given that both parent strains come from a Kush genetic line. When combusted, Starfighter often burns with a harsh, acrid smoke and leaves behind a taste of lemon on the exhale.This dynamic strain takes effect slowly, chipping away the the user’s conventional perception. Within minutes, smokers can detect a sharpening of the senses, with certain sights, sounds, and even tastes taking on new dimensions. Thoughts may flow more freely, facilitating creative thinking or deep analytical problem solving, depending on the user’s mood and setting. A psychedelic edge may creep in, and visual and auditory distortions are frequently reported. As the high wears on, Starfighter’s indica side shows itself, relieving tensions and keeping any overly cerebral thinking at bay. This excellent blend of mental and physical effects easily lends itself to mellow activities like listening to trippy music, binge-watching, and carrying on rambling conversations. Relaxing without being incapacitating, Starfighter has long-lasting effects even for more seasoned cannabis users.Just as its recreational uses are multifaceted, Starfighter can have wide-ranging applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can temporarily relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. This strain can also work physiologically, dulling entrenched aches and pains and soothing headaches and upset stomachs. Starfighter comes with a lower than average risk of “mind race” and paranoia, making it a good option for those who may be prone to panic or anxiety.Starfighter has proven to be an elusive strain in the cultivation market. The original breeding stock is either lost or very scarce -- there are some rumors of breeders paying up to $20,000 for pure, original Starfighter seeds! Luckily for the rest of us, Exotic Genetix has approximated this strain’s makeup and has made seeds available for sale online under the names Starfigher F1 and F2. Once obtained, Starfighter can be grown indoors or outdoors, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants have the short and bushy appearance typical of indicas; growers may want to ensure that any low-growing nodes receive enough light and air by regularly trimming away any broad fan leaves. Those looking to bring out this strain’s subtle purple hues should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Flowering begins within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, Starfighter can be a particularly pungent grow, and those looking to keep their indoor operations discreet should invest in measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Appropriate for use at virtually any time of day, Starfighter is the rare kind of hybrid that can be bent to the smoker’s will. It’s as enjoyable in buzzy social situations as it at home, and can spur on productivity or enable laziness. Its uniquely earthy and woodsy aroma can be particularly suited to a hike or a brisk nature walk.\n"

        "description": "With an unforgettable name and even more striking flavor, Blue Magoo is a pleasant, indica-leaning hybrid. Produced by breeders Dynasty Seeds -- Portland-based breeders known for popular local strains like Caramel Cough and Huckleberry Diesel   -- it is a cross between a specific cut of Blueberry cultivated by breeder DJ Short and a phenotype of William’s Wonder dubbed F2. Blue Magoo delivers mostly sedative phys effects, brightened up by a subtle cerebral head buzz. These striking flowers gets high marks from cannabis lab Analytical 360, testing at between 16% and 21% THC.Blue Magoo’s impressive flowers are medium to large in size and have sativa-typical buds with a long, almost conical shape. Rather than being densely-packed, the loose and fluffy leaves pull away easily from their central stems. They are a muted shade of green with a yellowish tint and are threaded through with rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Certain Blue Magoo phenotypes also show off different shades of blue and purple hues in their leaves. These latter colors emerge when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Trichomes cover the multicolored flowers, accounting for this strain’s potency and giving it a very sticky texture. The unmistakable scent of blueberry jumps off of the cured buds, clearly the influence of parent strain Blueberry. Lurking underneath this fruity aroma is a dank and pine-scented musk. When burnt, Blue Magoo has a harsh smoke that may trigger coughing and watery eyes. A tart and slightly herbal berry flavor comes through when smoke is exhaled. Notably, there are no discernible grape tastes at play here -- this may be because the aforementioned pigments that give Blue Magoo its occasional purple hues do not have a corresponding effect on the strain’s taste.Blue Magoo’s high hits somewhat quickly for an indica, granting almost instant relaxation. Shortly after they’ve finished savoring this stain’s signature taste, smokers may find themselves able to breathe more easily and may feel relief from pent-up muscular tension. And although Blue Magoo’s high is easygoing and sedative, it buzzes along with some slight mental stimulation, facilitating creative thinking or pleasant conversation. That said, the likelihood of couch-lock increases as greater amounts of this bud are consumed. As sedative effects intensify, Blue Magoo’s sativa side weakens, becoming more cloudy and dreamy than cerebral and analytical. This strain’s ultimate combination of physical relaxation and an mental contentment makes it a great option for both laid-back parties and solo unwinding after work. Because it tapers off into sleepiness, Blue Magoo is better suited to nighttime than afternoon use.Medical cannabis patients may also find value in Blue Magoo’s sedative properties. Its anti-inflammatory benefits can numb anything from troublesome aches and pains to migraines. It may also temporarily relieve the difficult symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Blind old Mr. Magoo himself might even benefit from Blue Magoo’s ability to soothe the painful intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Finally, this strain’s thorough relaxation can provide relief in stubborn cases of insomnia, lulling patients into a deep and restful sleep. Dynasty has not released seeds of Blue Magoo for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. While there’s limited information available on best practices for cultivating this strain, its mostly indica nature suggests that plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should “top off” their crops by pruning away any broad fan leaves that can block light from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Blue Magoo’s full purple bag appeal should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins. When grown indoors, Blue Magoo flowers within a brief 7 to 8 weeks.Given Blue Dream’s soaring popularity, it seems high time for another Blueberry-scented hybrid to take the legal cannabis market by storm. With rock-solid genetics and a universally-appealing taste, Blue Magoo is a clear front runner. Enjoy this drowsy flower with a small, intimate group of friends or alone while kicking back with a mellow album or movie.\n"

        "description": "Liberty Haze is a hybrid that has predominantly cerebral sativa effects. A cross between Mississippi-born G13 and sativa favorite Chemdawg, it is the brainchild of Barney’s Farm, a breeding operation that has also created flavor-focused strains like Tangerine Dream and Blue Cheese. With a dynamic, well-rounded taste and an energetic, it’s a great option for a any number of situations. Liberty’s Haze’s psychoactivity has even earned it the honor of best strain overall in the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Liberty Haze to have between 17% and a stunning 29% THC.Liberty’s Haze’s flowers betray its sativa character with long, tapered buds that are somewhat reminiscent of traditional Thai stick. These buds have a loose and fluffy texture and the leaves are easily torn away from their central stems. Leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are set off by many orange to red hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants). Transparent trichomes ensure that the flowers are sticky and very potent, but leaves them without the silver sheen characteristic of other resinous strains. When buds of Liberty Haze are properly cured, they give off the relatively rare aroma of lime. On closer inspection, this citrus tang is grounded out by more dank, kushy base notes. This strain burns with a smooth smoke and tastes like lime on the exhale; smokers may also pick up on some subtle spicy and herbal flavors.The effects of Liberty Haze take hold of users quickly in the form of a bracing head high. A steady pressure can be discerned around the eyes and temples. There is also a marked change in perception that may prove disorienting at first; smokers may suddenly find them some more observant or even hyper-aware of their surroundings. Once they’ve become accustomed to this altered state, though, users can point this energetic thoughtfulness in any direction they choose. Liberty Haze can provide the motivation you need to get out and accomplish some errands. Alternatively, it can help accomplish work, whether creative and artistic or more analytical and task-based. It may also be a great way to bond and relax with friends, whether you’re staying in or taking a hike on a beautiful day. A classic “wake and bake” strain, Liberty Haze is not recommended for use before bedtime. Its strong cerebral can be long-lasting, even for cannabis veterans.Just as Liberty Haze has recreational uses that affect the mind, its medical applications are also mostly psychological (although its anti-inflammatory properties may confer some benefits for minor aches and pains or for an irritated stomach). Its sustained feeling of focus and acuity can be helpful for those with attention deficit disorders. For patients with mild to moderate stress and depression, it can open up channels of perception and mood, allowing the afflicted to feel more present and “in the moment.” Negative side effects include dry mouth. Because of its tendency to bring about recursive thinking and paranoia, Liberty Haze may also be not best choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance. Breeders Barney’s Farm have made seeds of Liberty Haze available for commercial sale. Like many sativas, this strain has hearty genetics that allow it to be successfully grown indoors or out -- although outdoor cultivation requires warm, Mediterranean-like climates. Its plants are somewhat tall (and can stretch during their flowering period), but their height can be managed if growers prune and trim branches early on in the vegetative stage. Parent strain Chemdawg was specifically selected for its quick maturation and Liberty Haze follows in kind, flowering within a fast 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors. This strain also offers growers an exceptionally high yield for their efforts: growers can expect about 60 grams (or 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Liberty Haze’s enduring head buzz is a great way to keep a party rolling or to just enjoy some quality solo time. If you do share, though, bring enough for everyone, as its signature lime taste deserves to be spread and savored.\n"

        "description": "As one of most popular hybrids in circulation today, Girl Scout Cookies has gained quite a following. Its stable genetics have made it a valuable strain for crossbreeding in strains like Animal Cookies, but it’s also yielded some phenotypes that are distinct enough to merit a fan base of their very own. Peppermint Cookies is one such Girl Scout Cookies phenotype, grown and sold by Gold Leaf Gardens, the Seattle-based producers also responsible for Tangie. It is a slightly indica-leaning variety of Girl Scout Cookies (which is itself a cross between OG Kush and Durban Poison) that scores high marks for its stimulating, well-balanced high and its sharp herbal taste. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s psychoactivity at an impressive 24%.Flowers of Peppermint Cookies tend to be on the smaller side and have a characteristically indica bud structure -- the cured flowers hold together in dense, spherical clusters with tightly-coiled leaves. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green with hairy yellow to orange pistils. Many phenotypes also display subtle purple hues in their leaves; these surprising colors come about when certain pigments in the strain’s genetics are briefly stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. The flowers are also covered in sticky white trichomes that give them a dewy appearance.On first inspection, the buds have a sour, musky odor that may hit the back of your palate and make your eyes water. There’s also a slightly minty, herbal character that brightens up these dank scents. Breaking up or grinding the buds yields notes of pine. When combusted, Peppermint Cookies gives off a smooth smoke that on exhale has a certain creamy, biscuity taste -- the overall impression may remind some users of raw cookie dough. Notably, despite appearing purple, Peppermint Cookies has no discernible grape flavor; this is because the pigments that determine the way these flowers look does not have a corresponding effect on their taste.Peppermint Cookies has a high that mounts slowly and gradually before its effects can be fully detected. The initial effects may be disorienting, as users may find themselves suddenly struck with a sharpened perception of otherwise ordinary stimuli. In certain situations, this may lead to a feeling of “mind race,” with freely-associative thoughts jumping quickly from one to the next. As the high wears on, however, this strain’s stoney indica side creeps in, rendering smokers relaxed and contented. Peppermint Cookies’ blend of perceptual distortion and deep relaxation means that this strain may not be the best choice for concentrating on intense, important tasks. Instead, let yourself become happily hazy and dreamy as you kick back in the closest comfortable surroundings. Enjoy Peppermint Cookies on your own as an accompaniment to a mellow album or movie, or bring it out to share with friends and enjoy a giggly, rambling conversation. Because of its holistic and evenhanded high, Peppermint Cookies is appropriate for use at any time of day.Medically speaking, Peppermint Cookies is an effective analgesic, numbing chronic aches and pains and easing muscular tension. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also be good for headaches and nausea. On the psychological side of things, this strain’s way of elevating mood and subtracting stress from everyday situations also makes it a good way to temporarily relieve the acute symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Negative side effects include a persistent feeling of dry mouth. Because of the sedative body high that comes on Peppermint Cookies’ backend, it comes with a lower-than-average risk of paranoia, making it a good choice for patients who are prone to panic.Breeders Gold Leaf Gardens have not released seeds of Peppermint Cookies for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow “clones.” Although there is limited information available on ideal cultivation practices for this particular phenotype, we know that Girl Scout Cookies itself can thrive indoors or outdoors, provided that outdoor growing takes place in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Girl Scout Cookies is also known for having short, bushy, indica-leaning plants that are easily accommodated in indoor growing operations. Those looking to bring out this strain’s eye-catching purple bag appeal should expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.With a unique taste and a crowd-pleasing high to boot, Peppermint Cookies has a versatility that can help it surge in the newly-legal cannabis market. It’s a potent and welcome additions to the Girl Scout Cookies strain family.\n"

        "description": "Although sour cream may be controversial when used as a condiment, the strain Sour Cream has a much more universal appeal. This sativa-leaning hybrid is the product of G-13 Haze and perennial favorite Sour Diesel. It was created by Amsterdam-based breeders DNA Genetics, the same producers who have given us Chocolope and a stabilized cut of Headband dubbed “707”.Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Sour Cream’s psychoactivity at a steady 17% THC.Sour Cream is distinguished by impressively large, solid flowers. When cured, they adhere in the dense, heavy bud structure typical of indicas, but have the tapered, conical shape more typical of sativas. The leaves are bright shade of kelly green and have a slightly yellowish tint.Hairy brown pistils thread themselves through the tightly-packed leaves and amber-colored trichomes dot the flowers’ surfaces, making them particularly sticky and difficult to break up by hand. The primary aroma of this strain is a skunky musk, tinged with a heady gasoline tang passed on from parent strain Sour Diesel. A sharp citrus odor brightens up these earthy base notes. Breaking open or grinding the nugs yields a funky, faintly cheesy smell. When combusted, Sour Cream is smooth and easy on the throat, although its acrid odors may sting eyes or sinuses a bit. On the exhale, smoke tastes of dank earth and sour lemon.The high from Sour Cream comes on quickly in the form of a head rush and a mounting pressure behind the eyes and temples. Initial effects manifest as a surge in cerebral focus: sounds and colors may seem sharper or more noticeable and may take on a newly psychedelic nature. As this high progresses, users will detect a creeping tingle that soon spreads through the body as thorough relaxation. Breathing many happen more slowly and easily and any deep-seated muscular tension will evaporate. If dosage is increased, this sedation can graduate into full-on couch-lock. That said, smokers remain lucid and conversational, able to focus on tasks -- particularly stressful ones -- without the disadvantages and distractions of stress. Because it is neither overly cerebral nor overly sedative, Sour Cream is appropriate for use at any time of day.This balanced strain has many applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its relaxing properties may help ease users’ aches and pains, whether they’re incidental (as due to injury) or chronic (as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia). Sour Cream’s anti-spasmodic properties can also lessen the severity of certain seizure conditions. In high enough amounts, this strain’s sedation can be a treatment for stubborn cases of insomnia. Psychologically speaking, Sour Cream’s sustained sense of focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. Finally, because its sativa nature is grounded out by indica relaxation, the likelihood of paranoia is lower, making Sour Cream a good option for those who are prone to panic or have a low THC tolerance.DNA Genetics has made seeds of Sour Cream available for commercial sale. In can be grown indoor or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Like many sativa-dominant strains, Sour Cream has a long flowering time of about 10-11 weeks when grown indoors; it is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. This strain offers growers a high yield for their efforts, giving up about 46 to 55 grams (or 1.6 to 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. It can also be an especially pungent grow, so those looking to keep their indoor operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Growers should also take the time to properly cure their carefully-grown buds. Curing involves first hanging the buds upside down for 7 to 10 days in conditions with 50% humidity and temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Once stems can easily snap off of the flowers, the dried buds should be sealed in airtight jars in conditions of 60-65% humidity and a consistent temperature around 70 degrees. After they’re jarred, buds should be checked at least daily to ensure that they haven’t developed mold.Sour Cream strikes the coveted balance between indica and sativa. It’s a great choice for cannabis fans who’d like to concentrate their mental energy while remaining free of the potential anxiety that comes with stronger, purer sativas.\n"

        "description": "Cheesequake (or Cheese Quake) is a mostly indica hybrid created by TGA Subcool Seeds, the breeding collective also known for inventive varieties like Jesus OG and Conspiracy Kush. This strain is a cross between pungent staple Cheese and the fruity indica Querkle. A versatile smoke, Cheesequake can provide a powerful and enduring high that’s friendly to novice and experienced smokers alike. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s potency at as low as 13% and as high as 22% THC.Cheesequake’s buds are not especially visually striking. The flowers are small to medium in size and hold together in the dense, popcorn-like bud structure typical of indicas. The leaves are a mossy green, threaded through with plenty of hairy orange pistils. Certain phenotypes also show off shades of purple, ranging from lavender to a deep indigo. These hues are the result of a process in which pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Cheesequake’s flowers are also covered in cloudy white trichomes, making them very resinous to the touch. This strain has a scent that will appeal to fans of bold flavors: parent plant Cheese comes through on the nose with a sour, tangy funk. Hanging out underneath are some clashing floral, berry, and grape notes passed on from Querkle. Notably, any grape aroma or taste is totally coincidental to Cheesequake’s purple leaves -- the pigments responsible for the strain’s color do not correspond to its flavor profile. Although the strain’s smoke is smooth to inhale, all these flavors can make for an acrid, eye-stinging smell when the buds are burnt. There is a simultaneously sweet and sour taste on the exhale that may provide divisive for some consumers. This is a particularly pungent flower, so those who’d like to keep their smoking discreet should take any needed precautions.Cheesequake hits smokers relatively quickly, with a tingle around the eyes and forehead. Soon after, users may detect a slight uptick in mood, along with a sharpening of the senses -- sights and sounds may seem more intense, or at least more noticeable. Despite these initial sativa effects, though, sustained cerebral thinking is not particularly common. As the high progresses, some soothing indica relaxation emerges on the backend. This strain shines with its numbing full-body high, setting the stage for both solo enjoyment and laid-back group socializing. The mild feeling of mental stimulation also makes Cheesequake a good way to enhance your appreciation of trippy music or visually stimulating movies. Finally, because its high can be both mental and physical, this strain is great for activities that involve all your faculties, like exercise, dancing, or sex.Just as the recreational effects of Cheesequake are wide-ranging, there are also many benefits for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily take the edge off of the difficult symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Patients with attention deficit disorders may also be helped by its easygoing focus and lucidity. Somatically speaking, Cheesequake can be a good painkiller for injuries, as well as chronic aches and pains from conditions like lupus or arthritis. Anti-inflammatory properties also make it effective in treating migraines as well as milder headaches.Prospective Cheesequake growers can buy seeds online from TGA Genetics. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although indoor growing calls for semi-humid, Mediterranean-type climates with constant sunlight. Those who choose to grow indoors should “top” the plants, pruning away fan leaves to let light reach the lower flowering nodes. Pruning branches early on can also help these medium-tall plants maintain a manageable height appropriate for indoor grow spaces. Growers who’d like to highlight Cheesequake’s purple potential should also artificially “shock” the plants by exposing them to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Perhaps predictably, it can also be a very smelly grow, and growers may want to invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Don’t be fooled by its in-your-face flavor profile; Cheesequake’s is soothing and forgiving. It can set just the right vibe, whether you’re trying to keep conversations flowing or to simply kick back at home.\n"

        "description": "Blue Boy is a thoughtful, sativa-leaning hybrid crafted from the crowd-pleasing genetics of Blue Dream and Northern Lights #5. This potent strain comes to us from Washington state and offers an active, creative high with a sweet and fruity taste to boot. There’s nothing “little” about this boy blue -- although Blue Boy’s psychoactivity has been measured as low as 11% THC, it can reach levels as high as 27%.Blue Boy’s flowers mark this strain as more of a full-grown man than a boy. The impressive buds are large and solidly-packed, with a pronounced conical shape that underscores the similarities between cannabis and its flavorful cousin plant, hops. The leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are threaded through with contrasting rust-colored pistils. Notably, phenotypes of Blue Boy do not often display the blue and purple hues famously associated with parent strain Blue Dream. Glistening trichomes coat Blue Boy’s flowers, accounting for their potency and making them very sticky when properly cured.Berry is the primary scent that wafts up from flowers of Blue Boy, although there’s an undeniable citrus character hiding underneath as well. The powerfully sweet aroma is also grounded by a hint of pine. Breaking or grinding up the buds, meanwhile, gives off some rich and spicy herbal notes, likely passed on from Northern Lights. Don’t be fooled by Blue Boy’s agreeable aroma, though -- when combusted, it gives off a sharp, acrid smoke that can sting the palate and make sensitive eyes water. This strain finishes with some minty, herbal notes on the exhale.Blue Boy works slowly, sometimes taking as much as 15 minutes after users have finished savoring its delectable taste before it makes itself known. At first, the high emerges as a mounting pressure around the eyes and sinuses, often leading to red eye; those looking to keep their consumption discreet should keep a pair of eye drops handy. As it takes hold, Blue Boy works on the mind, triggering a kind of rapid-fire associative thinking that, in the right set and setting, lends itself to stimulating conversation or probing solo thought experiments. In more unnerving surroundings, though, Blue Boy can veer into disorienting “mind race” territory. Ideally, smokers will acclimate to Blue Boy’s fast-paced high and apply it to a variety of situations -- it’s great for spending quality time with friends and can be a valuable aid in working through a pesky to-do list. As the high wears on, a mellow physical feeling creeps in, which feels more like a tingle than the full-on body melt that can come with pure indicas. Because its effects are more energizing than relaxing, Blue Boy is a great choice for waking-and-baking. It can be used at any other time of day, although consuming just before bed may leave users wired and restless.Blue Boy can have both mental and somatic applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its productive and motivational vibes may be of some use to those with mild to moderate stress and depression, helping them to live more presently and to spend time “in the moment.” Its sustained sense of focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on single tasks. Physiologically, Blue Boy can dull aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. It may also relieve the painful intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Because its sativa onset may lead to some degree of anxiety or paranoia, Blue Boy is not recommended for those who are prone to panic.No large-scale commercial cannabis breeders have made seeds of Blue Boy available for sale. As such, those looking to cultivate the strain at home must obtain clippings from a reputable grower in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best practices for raising a Blue Boy crop, we do know that, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or in warm, humid climates outdoors. We also know that both parent strains offer an above-average yield when mature, with Blue Dream giving up as much as 56 grams (2 ounces) per square foot of plant.Hybrid fans should jump at the chance to sample a bowl of Blue Boy. Its energy and pleasant physical sensations show off the best of both sativa and indica genetics. It can be a great accompaniment for hiking or video games. Blue Boy also acts as a very good social lubricant and is certain to attract some attention at parties with its fruity, dynamic aroma.\n"

Although BioQueen has not made this strain’s exact lineage publicly known, its slightly sleepy vibes imply that this otherwise well-balanced strain has a hefty dose of indica in its background. Furthermore, some have speculated that Blue Diamond’s naming convention points to a cross between the ever-popular Blue Dream and the potent Diamond OG. Whatever its genetic makeup, Blue Diamond’s potency appeals to cannabis novices and veterans alike. Although the strain is high in THC, there are also some high-CBD varietals in circulation; these are calibrated for physically therapeutic, rather than psychoactive, use.Blue Diamond is marked by small to medium-sized nuggets that adhered in tapered, triangular shapes. Buds have the dense, tight structure typical of purely indica strains. The leaves are a mossy green and are shot through with curly red to orange hairs (which are actually pistils, reproductive structure intended to catch pollen from male plants). A few phenotypes of the strain also exhibit hints of purple in their leaves -- these hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in Blue Diamond’s genetics which reveal blue and purple shades when stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Crystalline trichomes dot these already-colorful flowers, giving them a slightly white sheen.When properly cured, Blue Diamond  bursts with a berry aroma that is equal parts sweet and tart. A distinct piney scent grounds out these acidic topnotes. Additionally, Blue Diamond has a slight, underlying funk, reminiscent of skunk or fertilizer. Breaking up or grinding the buds yields some deep, hashy flavors, perhaps revealing some Afghani landrace in this strain’s background. Blue Diamond burns with a smooth and easy smoke when combusted and tastes somewhat grassy and vegetal on the exhale.Blue Diamond’s high builds gradually, manifesting within minutes as an increase in emotional well-being. Many smokers describe a sense of euphoria some time after consuming. Although the initial effects are squarely head-focused, this strain is unlikely to lead to a cerebral mindset, though, more often resulting in a sort of passive, dreamy haze. Smokers may experience phenomena like amplified sights or sounds, and may even have a distorted perception of time. These trippy effects make Blue Diamond a great accompaniment to easy but stimulating activities like an afternoon stroll. This strain is not without some creativity, either -- smokers experiencing free-associative thinking should jot down any thoughts or impressions. As time passes, this hybrid’s indica force really kicks in, with a mounting heaviness in the core and limbs. Breathing happens more easily as physical tension evaporates. For the uninitiated -- or for those who overindulge -- this relaxation can lead to full-on couch-lock, causing smokers to melt into their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background. Blue Diamond’s spaced-out and relaxed vibes make it great for spending intimate time with loved ones or for spending some introspective time unwinding alone. Because of its sedative, almost narcotic nature, Blue Diamond is best enjoyed in the evening or just before bed, as it can easily transition smokers into a fulfilling sleep.Blue Diamond may have some utility for medical cannabis patients as well. Its heavy somatic relaxation can ease aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. It may also provoke hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or harsh treatments like chemotherapy. As noted, Blue Diamond can provide relief from insomnia. Because it doesn’t bring about an intense thoughtfulness, this strain is a good option for users who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Although BioQueen has made seeds of Blue Diamond available online, stock levels of the strain can waver. Alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from trusted breeders in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Blue Diamond can be cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. The short and bushy plants take well to confined indoor spaces. Growers looking to boost the likelihood of purple hues in Blue Diamond’s flowers should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within a short 8 weeks when grown indoors.Whether you’re enjoying Blue Diamond in front of the TV or passing it around the campfire, this strain is sure to help you appreciate the many gifts that nature has to offer.\n"

        "description": "A strain that embodies the grassroots, D.I.Y. ethos of old-school cannabis culture, Blue Dot was originally created by an unidentified medical cannabis patient in Sonoma, California. This sativa-dominant hybrid is a blend of Leda Uno, Northern Lights, and Haze. It confers an active, cerebral high alongside a robust flavor profile. Blue Dot’s potency has been measured at between a modest 11% and a solid 20% THC. Blue Dot sets itself apart with unique, eye-catching flowers. The nugs are medium-sized and have a tapered, spade-like shape. Despite predominantly sativa genetics, flowers have the densely-packed bud structure more often associated with indica varieties The leaves are particularly striking: like a camouflage print, they are flecked with various shades of green, ranging from sage to a dark forest green. Orange and brown pistils thread their way through these colorful flowers, while a high volume of cloudy white trichomes give the buds a slightly silver sheen.When properly cured, buds of Blue Dot emit a mixture of earthy and fruity aromas. Bright and tart cherry scents mingle with a strong underlying dankness. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the buds yields a powerfully hashy scent, verging on sickly-sweet. When combusted, these flavors coalesce in an acrid smoke that may cause users to cough and may make their eyes water. Blue Dot’s hash and incense notes become even more prominent when the strain is smoked. When exhaled, the strain leaves behind a faintly peppery taste -- perhaps testifying to the Haze in its genetics. Those consuming Blue Dot in public should keep in mind that this can be a very pungent and indiscreet strain when burnt. Blue Dot offers what can be described as a creeper of a high, sometimes taking several minutes before its effects are fully felt. Don’t be fooled by this slow onset, though -- when Blue Dot hits, it hits hard, with a smack of pressure around the eyes and temples. What follows is a surge of euphoric energy that immerses smokers in their own thoughts. As a result, it’s important to consume this powerful strain in a properly comfortable and familiar set and setting. Under ideal conditions, Blue Dot can bring about some deep analytical thinking that’s as good for creative projects as it is for more prosaic, problem-solving scenarios. Alternatively, this strain can grant the motivation needed to get up and go, whether you need to clean the house or go out for a brisk run. Some may find that Blue Dot’s energy has an emotional tint, leading them to feel social and even downright giddy. Free-flowing conversation can happen easily, even with new acquaintances. As the high wears on, Blue Dot’s body high emerges, relaxing smokers but not incapacitating them to the point of couch-lock. This combination of mental and physical effects makes the strain good for activities that involve both mental presence and physical coordination -- including exercise, video games, and sex. Blue Dot can be enjoyed at any time of day, although the possibility of cerebral mind race may make some re-think smoking this strain just before bed.Blue Dot also has psychological and somatic uses for medical cannabis patients. Its power to alter mood can benefit those suffering from moderate stress and depression by helping them to spend their time more consciously and mindfully. Blue Dot’s long-lasting feeling of focus can be of use to those with attention deficit disorders. Although slight, the strain’s physical relaxation can soothe aches and pains, as well as incidental annoyances like headaches and nausea. Because of the likelihood of paranoia resulting from its cerebral intensity, Blue Dot is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic and anxiety.Perhaps because of its off-the-grid origin, Blue Dot has not been bred for seed production or sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow clones. Blue Dot can be successfully cultivated indoor and out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. Finally, just as it is pungent when smoked, Blue Dot can be just as pungent when grown -- those looking to keep their indoor grow operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters.Prized for its unmotivated energy and positivity, Blue Dot should not be passed up if it’s spotted on dispensary shelves\n"

        "description": "Blue Frost is a slightly indica-dominant hybrid with standout flowers and an unforgettable taste. Created by Goldenseed, U.K.-based breeders who have stabilized taste-focused strains like Blue Cheese and Lemon Skunk, it is a cross between complex indica Blue Monster and Goldenseed’s own Jack Frost. Although its flavor -- containing hints of fruit, cheese, and mint -- is something of an acquired taste, this strain’s potent, well-rounded high can’t be denied. Blue Frost’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 15% and 22%.Blue Frost’s bag appeal is obvious right away. Its flowers, although small to medium in size, have a distinctive conical shape. These tapered buds hang together in a somewhat loose, ragged bud structure; leaves appear fluffy and can be easily torn away from their central stems. The leaves are predominantly a mossy green, although many phenotypes of the strain exhibit patches of surprising colors like pale blue and deep violet. These hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Translucent white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of the already-colorful leaves, giving them a sticky texture and a silvery sheen.As with so many hybrids in the Blue family, the smell of grapes and sweet blueberries wafts up from the cured buds. Lurking underneath, though, is a tangy, cheesy funk, possibly passed on from grandparent strain G-13. Breaking up or grinding the buds yields some of the pronounced herbal notes that make grandparent strain Jack Herer so popular. When buds of Blue Frost are burnt, they give off a rich and surprisingly smooth smoke. That said, all of these concentrated and contrasting aromas tend to clash when inhaled all at once; some may find Blue Frost’s flavor profile somewhat rank and unpleasant. There’s some relief on the exhale, though, which leaves behind a faintly herbal, minty taste. Blue Frost can be particularly pungent when smoked -- those consuming it in public should take any necessary precautions to maintain discretion.Blue Frost’s high sets in quickly, leaving smokers briefly disoriented as the strain’s fruity, funky clouds begin to dissipate. Initial effects include a sharpened perception of external stimuli as well as a qualitative uptick in mood. Smokers may find themselves drawn to thoughts, impressions, and even sights or sounds that might otherwise seem mundane. They may also sense an increased sociability, marked by talkativeness and, in some cases, giddiness. In short order, waves of physical relaxation tumble down from the neck, spreading over the user’s core and limbs. This meld of mental alertness and physical sedation make Blue Frost a great strain for unwinding after a long day or week of work. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couch-lock becomes more likely; smokers are content to relax and kick back, remaining lucid even as they melt into their surroundings. Because of the lazy vibes that creep in on its backend, Blue Frost is best enjoyed in the early evening or just before bed.Blue Frost can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its euphoric effects can temporarily counteract the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even PTSD, while its clearheaded feeling of focus can assist those with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically speaking, Blue Frost can also numb deep-seated aches and pains. Its anti-inflammatory effects may take care of passing problems like headaches or nausea and indigestion. Because its mental effects do not often take a turn into paranoia, this strain can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Goldenseed has made seeds of Blue Frost available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight. As with many predominantly indica strains, its plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches and are well accommodated indoors. Growers should “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that might block light and discourage the growth of any low-lying flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Blue Frost’s signature colors should also expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blue Frost takes a long time to flower for an indica: it matures within 10 to 11 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors.With its versatile high and crowd-pleasing taste, Blue Frost is great for some mellow time with friends or as a solo treat while unwinding. If you do bring it out in public, be prepared for its striking flowers and pungent tang to turn a few heads.\n"

        "description": "Although it sounds like a substance from an apocalyptic sci-fi novel, Blue Goo is actually a sativa-dominant hybrid with some serious bag appeal. It is a cross between the uber-popular Blue Dream and the landrace-derived Afgoo. This strain has a complex flavor profile that contains notes of berries, gasoline, and pine, among others. It also offers a well-balanced high that will appeal to sativa fans who’d rather not spend too much time in their heads. Blue Goo’s potency has been measured at between 16% and 22% THC.Blue Goo’s small to medium flowers are notable for their nearly spherical shapes. The orbs cling together in the dense and tight bud structure often associated with indicas. Most striking, though, is their color -- the leaves are a dark shade of forest green and, more often than not, contains streaks of deep purple; these latter colors come about when pigments in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. A dusting of small white trichomes cover these colorful buds like confectioner’s sugar, while hairy red pistils wind their way through the tightly-packed leaves.When properly cured, Blue Goo gives off the unmistakable scent of blueberries. This tart aroma is grounded out by woodsy hints of pine and cedar, giving the flowers an overall musty berry character. On closer inspection, the buds also have the astringent tang of diesel. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the sticky flowers yields some earthy, peppery notes, courtesy of grandparent landrace strain Afghani. When Blue Goo is combusted, it burns with a surprisingly smooth smoke that leaves behind an earthy, fruity taste on the exhale. Notably, Blue Goo has no discernible grape flavors -- this is because the anthocyanin pigments that dictate the plants’ color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.Blue Goo proffers a high that builds slowly, eventually revealing a mellow sativa energy marked by acute sensory perception and improvement in mood. Smokers can expect to find themselves mentally engaged by their surroundings, but still sufficiently grounded by Blue Goo’s indica side that they can follow lucid patterns of thought and conversation. The lack of frantic “mind race” makes this strain good for calm, creative thinking, as well as for analytical approaches to problem-oriented scenarios. Within little time, Blue Goo’s indica side emerges as a soothing physical tingle. These relaxing vibes may not plunge users into immobile couch-lock, although it can make some more active pursuits like exercise or running errands distinctly uncomfortable. Instead, smokers may prefer to spend time indoors with close friends as they enjoy Blue Goo’s even-handed sedation. This strain can be enjoyed at any time of day, although it may be more welcome in the late afternoon or early evening due to the way that it tapers off into bodily calm.Medical cannabis patients may also find value in Blue Goo’s versatile effects. It can take the edge off the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety, depression, or PTSD. It may also serve as an effective analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re incidental, as due to injury or more chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Because users do not often report an uncontrolled feeling of intense cerebral thinking or paranoia, Blue Goo may be a good choice for those with panic disorders or those with a low tolerance for THC.No large-scale breeders have made seeds of Blue Goo available for sale online. Those looking to grow the strain will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Those looking to accentuate Blue Goo’s striking purple hues should also expose their crops to colder than average temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blue Goo flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.Neither too floaty nor too weighty, Blue Goo is an ideal hybrid for maintaining focus, sociability, and positive attitudes. If spotted on dispensary shelves, pick up a double dose -- an eighth of this delicious bud may not last you very long.\n"

        "description": "Cannasutra is a full-bodied indica with soothing and arousing effects. Like pop star Sting, Cannastura’s producers Delta 9 Labs must be fond of this strain’s namesake the Kama Sutra -- the ancient Hindu text on philosophy, love, and sex; indeed, Cannasutra is said to provoke desire and augment sexual encounters. Created as cross between award-winning Sensi Star and pungent indica Reclining Buddha, this strain offers a potent, full-bodied high alongside a sweet and earthy flavor profile. Although Cannastura’s THC index has been measured at between 14% and 23%, there appear to be high-CBD varieties in circulation as well, with CBD to THC ratios as high as 2:1.Cannasutra is marked by small to medium flowers that cling together in pebbly, popcorn-like formations. Almost spherical in shape, the buds have a characteristically indica appearance, with a dense and tightly-packed structure. The leaves range in color from pale green to a darker shade of forest green and are threaded through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. A dusting of white trichomes gives these flowers a slightly dewy sheen and a very sticky texture.Cannasutra has a subtle aroma that flies under the radar with sweet, incense-like notes. On closer inspection, there’s also the rich and earthy suggestion of hash, perhaps due to the Afghani landrace rumored to be in parent strain Sensi Star’s lineage. Grinding up or breaking open Cannasutra’s small, dense buds yields some surprisingly astringent notes, reminiscent of ammonia and fuel. These contrasting flavors come together in a harsh, acrid smoke when Cannasutra is burnt. This strain may trigger some coughing on the exhale. Nevertheless, it finishes pleasantly, with a floral and grassy vegetal taste on the exhale.Like its scent, Cannasutra’s high begins subtly -- it may take several minutes before users feel a discernible change in mood. A sense of contentment may take over as smokers feel their muscular tension relax. Breathing may also happen more deeply and easily. Smokers may feel more physically sedate than psychologically stimulated, especially if consuming a high-CBD variant of the strain. That said, when somatic effects are particularly strong, the sheer force of Cannasutra’s body high may be more than enough to have users feeling trippy and altered. This bud may come with some trace amounts of mental stimulation do to the trace amounts of sativa in genetics. The resulting mild head high can take the form of a contemplative mindset or a free-flowing conversation. As noted, Cannasutra’s meld of mental and physical effects can also work particularly well as an aphrodisiac. This luxurious strain is best enjoyed in the later afternoon to early evening, as its palpable physical relaxation may eventually lull users to sleep.Cannasutra may have benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its deep relaxation and subsequent mood uplift can temporarily alleviate the symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression. Physiologically speaking, this strain may also soothe aches and pains whether they’re incidental, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Finally, in high enough doses, Cannasutra can work against even stubborn cases of insomnia. Because it comes with a low risk of cerebral intensity or mind-race, this strain is a good choice for those with a low THC tolerance or those who are prone to panic.Delta 9 Labs have made seeds of Cannasutra available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. The short and bushy plants can thrive indoors, provided that growers provide sufficient space for the strong lateral branches. Cannasutra may require more feeding or nutrients than other strains, but growers should be wary of the fact that it is also sensitive to overwatering. Cannasutra flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. It offers a modest yield of 28 to 46 grams (or about 1 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Cannasutra’s peaceful and easygoing should be savored in whichever environment the user prefers: it can be a great way to enhance camaraderie in social situations, to create intimacy in romantic settings, or simply to set the stage for some quality “me” time.\n"

        "description": "Gucci OG is an indica-leaning hybrid whose name is evidence of the increasing effects of conspicuous consumption on the burgeoning legal cannabis industry. Unlike its exclusive Italian fashion namesake, though, Gucci OG can be enjoyed by all. This well-balanced hybrid is a distinct phenotype of staple strain OG Kush and carries on all of its mother plant’s potency and pungency. With THC levels that have been measured at between 14% and a whopping 30%, Gucci OG is an appealing choice for cannabis newcomers and veterans alike.Gucci OG’s flowers immediately set this strain apart. The buds tend to be large and dense, clinging together in a solid, indica-typical structure. Buds also have distinctive shapes, ranging from slightly tapered and cone-like to almost entirely cylindrical. Meanwhile, the leaves are about as colorful as cannabis gets in the absence of blue and purple hues; they are a patchwork of mossy green leaves and bright orange pistils. Glittering, translucent white trichomes stand out against the leaves, making Gucci OG incredibly sticky and sure to leave behind a resinous dust when handled.When properly cured, Gucci OG has all the kushy pungency of its parent plant. Sour citrus is the primary smell here, striking the back of the palate and making eyes tear up even before the bud is burnt. These bright top notes are grounded out by the earthy musk of wet soil and pine. These earthy aromas emerge even more when Gucci OG is ground up or broken open -- some even compare the gamey, musky scent to that of leather. Despite its dank flavors, though, Gucci OG burns with a smooth and light-tasting smoke. Its sharp taste and odor can linger for a while afterwards; those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to take some precautions.Gucci OG begins to take effect fairly quickly and starts with an increase in free-associative thinking. Abstract concepts or external stimuli may take on some absorbing new dimensions. Rather than leading to an uncontrollable feeling of mind race, though, Gucci OG keeps users in control of both thoughts and speech, Under these conditions, smokers may find themselves more social and conversational than usual. Gucci OG can also facilitate everything from creative thinking to methodical, analytical problem solving. A body high emerges just as users begin to peak, resulting in a potent meld of physical and mental effects. Ripples of bodily relaxation may relieve tension without necessarily leading to couch-lock. This strain’s versatile high can be pointed in whichever direction the user prefers -- it’s great for social and athletic activities like making an excursion with friends, exercising, or simply spending some introspective time alone. Gucci OG can be enjoyed at any time of day, although it may keep users briefly wired if they toke before bed. A little bit of this bud also goes quite a long way, even for smokers with a high THC tolerance.Gucci OG may also have wide-ranging users for medical cannabis patients. Its long-lasting and clearheaded mental state can benefit those with moderate cases of anxiety, depression, or even PTSD, helping them to live more presently and “in the moment.”  It can also help patients with attention deficit disorders to maintain concentration. Gucci OG’s subtle physical relaxation may provide relief from deep-seated aches and pains, while its anti-inflammatory properties can soothe irritations like headaches or indigestion. Because some users may find its cerebral intensity to be disorienting, those who are prone to panic should consume this strain with caution and moderation.No commercial producers have made seeds of Gucci OG available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from healthy, mature plants in order to foster “clones.” Although there is limited information available on best cultivation practices for this strain, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid climates with consistent daytime sunlight. Gucci OG flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.Although its name may conjure images of bling and luxury, Gucci OG is a mellow and down to earth strain that’s just as enjoyable when you're at home in sweatpants as it is when you’re decked out for a night on the town.\n"

        "description": "Presidential Kush is an indica-leaning hybrid with a dynamic flavor profile. Not to be confused with Presidential OG, a strain created by Royal Queen Seeds, Presidential Kush is the brainchild of DNA Genetics, the same breeders responsible for taste-focused strains like Sour Cream and Chocolope. It is a cross between OG Kush and Lemon Skunk and offers a multifaceted high, beginning with mellow relaxation and later amping up into energetic mental focus. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of this strain to have between a modest 12% and a whopping 30% THC. Note that in certain locales and retail outlets, Presidential Kush may also be known as Lemon OG Kush.Presidential Kush is distinguished by medium to large-sized flowers. These buds appear rounded and almost spherical in shape, as is typical of many varieties in the Kush family. Fluffy leaves hang together in a loose and piecey bud structure and they can easily be torn away from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy shade of green and are threaded through with curly orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures intended to capture pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, Presidential Kush’s flowers boast a high volume of amber trichomes, giving the leaves a slightly yellow tint.Presidential Kush has the aromatic profile you might expect from a Kush and Lemon cross. When cured, it smells dank and earthy and gives the overall impression of damp soil. There are tart notes of citrus peeking through as well. When the buds are broken apart or ground up, the lemon scent becomes even more prominent. When combusted, Presidential Kush burns with a harsh and cough-inducing smoke. This smoke carries a citrus taste with some faint piney accents on the exhale.This strain offers what’s best described as a “creeper” of a high, sometimes taking several minutes after smokers have savored its unique tastes before its effects are fully felt. Gradually, smokers may detect a pressure around the eyes and the temples. This sensation is accompanied by a relief of muscular tension and a higher capacity for deep breathing. All of this therapeutic relaxation easily contributes to a euphoric state in which smokers can float along contentedly. In its early stages, Presidential Kush is not particularly cerebral. As the high progresses, though, a sativa edge begins to emerge. Users may notice an increase in thoughtfulness or an altered perception, with colors and sounds taking on vibrant new dimensions. Visual distortions are also often reported, giving this hybrid a distinctly psychedelic character. In the right set and setting, smokers can turn this newfound stimulation towards various mundane tasks and errands. Although Presidential Kush can be enjoyed at any time of day, it may be most appropriate in the morning or afternoon, allowing smokers to enjoy the strain’s initial relaxation and the subsequent burst of energy. The wide-ranging effects of Presidential Kush’s high may also be of value to medical cannabis patients. Those with attention deficit disorders may find that the strain’s sustained, clearheaded mindset can allow for focus on single tasks. Physiologically speaking, it may also relieve deep-seated aches and pains and can stoke hunger for those who’ve lost their appetites to medications or treatments like chemotherapy. Finally, Presidential Kush can relieve the painful intraocular pressure that is a primary symptom of glaucoma. Those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume this strain with caution, keeping in mind its mentally stimulating effects.DNA Genetics has made seeds of Presidential Kush available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 degree Fahrenheit range. The indica-typical plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Presidential Kush flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a fairly high yield of 42 to 51 grams (or 1.5 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Unlike heads of state, whose legacies can waver with time, Presidential Kush has firmly established its reputation. Its well-balanced high is as enjoyable alone as it is when shared with a group of close friends.\n"

        "description": "Alien Rift is a dynamic indica that represents a refinement of existing genetics. Prolific producers Ocean Grown Seeds have bred Alien Rift as an improvement on their signature Alien Abduction strain by backcrossing an Alien Abduction phenotype with Alien Dawg and Alien OG plants. The result is a tasty and highly resinous flower that's sure to leave you thoroughly spaced-out. Alien Rift's potency has been reported at between 20% and 24% THC.Alien Rift is marked by small to medium-sized buds that range in shape from conical to almost spherical. The mossy green leaves adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. Often, leaves also exhibit flashes of lavender and deep purple. These vibrant hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant's genetics are agitated by colder than average temperatures; the process is similar to way in which declining chlorophyll levels result in red and yellow foliage in autumn. Burnt orange pistils twist their way through these multicolored leaves. Ocean Grown Seeds specifically bred Alien Rift for sky-high trichome production and it shows in the blanket of milky-white resin glands that cover the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers.When properly cured, flowers of Alien Rift have a robust earthy aroma, accented by notes of pine and citrus. On closer inspection, there is also a distinct chemical tang lurking underneath, reminiscent of ammonia cleaning products. Breaking open or grinding up these sticky buds yields a hashy, incense-like odor. When combusted, Alien Rift burns with a surprisingly smooth smoke that tastes clean on the inhale. On the exhale, it leaves behind flavors of lemon and dank earth. Notably, Alien Rift has no discernible grape flavors to match its purple hues; this is because color and taste in cannabis plants are determined by two different chemical compounds -- pigments and terpenes, respectively.Alien Rift's high is subtle at first, sometimes taking a few bowls or tokes before its effects are fully felt. Initially, smokers may detect a sharpening of their senses, with sights, sounds, and even tastes taking on new dimensions. As they adjust to this altered state, users may also find that their attention is more focused and deliberate. This lucid (but not overly cerebral) mindset can lend itself to tasks like running through a to-do list or cleaning the house; it can also lead to increased talkativeness and sociability. Within relatively little time, Alien Rift's indica potency becomes apparent as a physical tingle spreads down from the neck and through the core and limbs. Users may detect palpable relief from physical tension and mental stress. This combination of physiological and psychological effects may prove somewhat trippy and can be an excellent accompaniment to a surreal movie or a favorite album. Note that as dosage increases, so does the likelihood of couch-lock. Even if users' minds remain active and focused, productivity dwindles in the later stages of the high. Alien Rift is as enjoyable when shared with friends as it is when savored alone. Finally, this strain is most appropriate for evening or nighttime use, when its drowsy vibes can eventually taper off into sleep.Alien Rift's wide-ranging effects may also have application for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained euphoria can temporarily obscure the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Its ability to focus mental attention on single tasks or concepts may also help those with attention deficit disorders. Alien Rift's more sedative effects can have a soothing effect on aches and pains, whether they're incidental as due to injury or chronic as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Because this strain's mental effects do not often veer into mind race or paranoia, it may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic.Ocean Grown has made seeds of Alien Rifts available for sale online. It can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. This strain's plants are classically indica, with bushy silhouettes and heights that rarely exceed 3 feet. Growers should regularly top their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Alien Rifts flowers within 8 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.Enjoy this out-of-this-world strain as a complement to a hazy weekend afternoon or at the end of a long day. You may also want to take advantage of Alien Rift's exceptional resin production to create hash -- you can browse the basics of making bubble hash via cold water extraction here.\n"

        "description": "Girl Scout Cookies is one of the most popular strains in circulation today, with a well-balanced high and rock-solid genetics that have spawned crossbreeds as diverse as Thin Mints and Animal Cookies. Not to be outdone, Boy Scout Cookies offers a mellow, indica-leaning high and a crowd pleasing taste. Although no commercial-grade producer has taken credit for BSC’s creation or revealed its lineage, this strain is rumored to be a cross between Girl Scout Cookies and OG Kush. Others conjecture that, like Girl Scout Cookies, BSC has one Durban Poison parent, which in this case is paired with flavorful Blueberry. Whatever its background, BSC is a potent smoking experience, with a THC content that’s been measured at between 19% and 24%BSC is marked by small to medium-sized buds that adhered in dense, cone-shaped form. The tapered buds have the solidly-packed structure more often associated with indica varieties. The twisting leaves are a bright shade of spring green. Many phenotypes also show off patches of purple in their leaves, the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics that yield blue and purple hues when excited by cold weather during the growing process. Hairy brown to orange pistils twist their way through these colorful flowers, while cloudy white trichomes dot the surfaces and give the buds a very sticky texture.Fans of GSC will be won over by BSC’s similar flavor profile. When properly cured, the flowers emit a dank, kushy odor, redolent of musk and wet soil. Some sweet and slightly citrus notes lurk underneath, brightening up the overall impression. Breaking up or grinding the dense buds also yields some notes of skunk and pine. When combusted, BSC gives off a smoke that can be harsh and acrid, tickling the palate and making eyes water. This pungent smoke has a sweet and biscuity tastes on the exhale. Notably, BSC has no discernible grape flavors despite its occasional purple coloring -- this is because while the strain’s colors are determined by pigments, its taste is determined by separate chemical compounds called terpenes.BSC’s high is a bit of a creeper and can take a few minutes to show itself; when it hits, though, it hits all at once, stunning smokers with a suddenly elevated mood and a sharper perception of external stimuli. Furthermore, freely-associative thought patterns can boost smokers’ creativity or propensity for conversation, making this a very social strain. A strong indica backbone keeps any mental effects from veering into overactive “mind race” territory. Smokers can maintain lucidity and focus as they crest this strain’s high. As time passes, BSC’s full physical relaxation kicks in, spurring a tingle that spreads from the core and down through the limbs and extremities. The powerful combination of mental and physical effects provides a great backdrop for everything from cleaning your apartment to lounging and listening to music with friends. As time passes or as dosage is increased, couch-lock becomes increasingly likely, pinning users down in the closest comfortable surroundings. BSC’s variety of effects make it appropriate for use at any time of day. It can be a great wake-and-bake strain, providing an initial burst of energy before tapering into afternoon relaxation. Alternatively, it can be a pleasant nighttime treat for unwinding at home before sleep sets in.BSC’s versatile effects can be beneficial for medical cannabis patients as well. Its waves of thorough physical sedation can alleviate aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may also relieve irritations like headaches or indigestion. In high enough doses, it can even combat particularly stubborn cases of insomnia. Because its initial cerebral effects are not overly intense, BSC is a good option for those who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.No breeders have made seeds of BSC available for sale online; as such, those looking to grow the stain must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to raise clones. BSC can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate with consistent daytime sunlight. Those looking to bring out the strain’s eye-catching purple potential should expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Somewhat difficult to come by, Boy Scout Cookies is worth sampling as an addition to the Cookie family. The strain’s calm, middle-of-the-road high stands to earn a place in the pantheon of popular staple strains.\n"

        "description": "Innovative breeders Alphakronik Genes have proven their genius with Stephen Hawking Kush. This heavy indica was bred for high CBD content and is a cross between CBD-rich HarleTsu and the colorful Sin City Kush. Stephen Hawking Kush is one in a conceptual series of strains by Alphakronik, dubbed the “Great Minds.” With more CBD than THC in its genes, SHK is an ideal strain for relieving pain and tension while sustaining focus and productivity. SHK offers three distinct phenotypes, all bearing similar flavors and effects.SHK’s flowers make it clear that this is one exception strain. The medium-sized buds are almost spherical in shape and display the loose, ragged bud structure often associated with pure sativas. The fluffy leaves are a dusky olive green and are threaded through with corkscrewing orange and pink pistils. More often than not, leaves also display vibrant shades of dark blue and purple; these dramatic colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. A blanket of glassy white trichomes covers these already-colorful bud, making them very sticky to the touch.SHK has a standout aroma to match its eye-catching visuals. When properly cured, the flowers emit a bright and fruity tang. The smell of berries mixes with hints of grape and makes this strain smell more sweet than dank. On closer inspection, there are subtle musky and hashy notes, possibly due to the Afghani landrace roots of parent strain HarleTsu. When combusted, SHK burns with a remarkably smooth smoke that tastes herbal and citrus on the exhale. Notably, this strain’s grape flavor is entirely coincidental to its purple color; while a strain’s colors are determined by pigment, its flavor profile is dictated by compounds called terpenes.SHK hits quickly for an indica, releasing waves of relaxation that roll down from the neck and through the core and limbs. These physical effects are accompanied by a progressively mounting sense of well-being, culminating in a subdued euphoria. In spite of the strain’s namesake astrophysicist, don’t count on Stephen Hawking Kush to boost your brainpower -- while this strain may trigger some free-associative thinking, its CBD to THC ratio isn’t likely to induce the kind of cerebral mindset suited to serious analytical work. Low THC levels also make this a great strain for going about your day with a clear head, while maintaining a refreshing sense of relief from stress or pain. In moderate doses, couch-lock is uncommon, making THC an enjoyable treat for daytime nighttime use. This strain’s combination of physical and subtle mental effects can also be a great way to enjoy activities that involve both the body and mind, like hiking, exercise, and even sex.SHK may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can provide  temporary relief from the distracting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, and can help those afflicted to spend their time more mindfully and deliberately. Its sedative effects can also soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary as due to injury or long-term as due to disease. SHK has been known to stoke hunger and may have value as a meal supplement for those who lost their appetite to medications or treatments like chemotherapy. Finally, because its low psychoactivity allows consumers to maintain lucidity, SHK is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Alphakronik Genes as mad seeds of this unique strain available for sale online. SHK’s different phenotypes each have distinct vegetative traits, ranging from tall, spindly plants to short and bushy ones. All strains can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Those looking to bring out the strain’s purple hues should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. SHK flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.With other strains in the Great Minds line inspired by figures like Nikola Tesla and Werner Heisenberg, Stephen Hawking Kush is in solid company. This gem of a strain is just the thing for achieving long-lasting pain relief or for giving yourself some serious R & R.\n"

        "description": "Paris OG is a potent and tasty indica almost certain to hit you with a knockout punch of sedation. This strain is a cross between Lemon OG and perennial favorite Headband and offers a mouth-puckering citrus taste, accompanied by a heavy and stoney body high. Different preparations of Paris OG have won various top prizes in the High Times Cannabis Cup between 2013 and 2016. This strain’s THC levels have been measured at between 18% and an impressive 28%.Paris OG is distinguished by medium to large flowers that adhere in a distinct cone shape. Despite mostly indica genetics, these buds show off some sativa properties, with a loose structure. The light and fluffy leaves can tear away easily from their central stems. The fluffy leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with hairy orange pistils. A high volume of cloudy white trichomes dots the inner and outer surfaces of the leaves, making them particularly hard to break up without the use of a grinder.A pronounced lemon tang jumps off of cured buds of Paris OG. This citrus character is supported by a generally fruity, tropical aroma that lurks in the background. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields earthy and dank notes, courtesy of the OG Kush in this strain’s lineage. Despite its mostly agreeable scent, Paris OG can give off a harsh, acrid smoke when burnt, which may trigger coughing for some. On the exhale, this strain tastes of lemon accented by a bit of pine.Paris OG offers what can be described as a creeper of a high. Several minutes after savoring its taste, smokers may detect a pressure around the temples -- this same feeling of cranial compression is exactly the side effect that gives parent strain Headband its name. As this bud takes over, users may feel their limbs become heavy with relaxation at the same time that their eyelids begin to droop. Paris OG’s physically relaxing effects may even be strong enough to bring about feelings of dissociation, making for a uniquely psychedelic experience. Smokers should not expect a cerebral increase in focus; instead, any mental stimulation arrives more in the form of a cloudy, dreamy mindset. Paris OG’s trippy vibes make it a great accompaniment to a favorite album or a moody, atmospheric movie. This strain is just the thing for winding down after a long day or week of work -- just beware of heavy couch-lock and the irresistible urge to sleep after you smoke a few more bowls. Because it is so sedative, Paris OG is best enjoyed in the early evening or as a treat just before bedtime. Paris OG’s sleepy, almost narcotic effects have the potential to help medical cannabis patients as well. Its relaxed, easygoing nature may temporarily numb the acute symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. It can also soothe all kind of aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. Paris OG’s anti-inflammatory properties may take care of everyday annoyances like headaches or nausea. Finally, as noted, this strain is a great choice for counteracting insomnia. Because Paris OG is unlikely to lead to patterns of intense, recursive thinking, it is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No large-scale commercial breeders have made seeds of Paris OG available for commercial sale. As such, those looking to grow the strain must obtain clippings from a mature, healthy plant in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although limited information is available on the best practices for cultivating this strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Because of its mostly indica genetics, we also know that plants of Paris OG grow short and bushy. Growers should regularly “top” their plants, by trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves that can inhibit the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches.Better suited to passive indoor use than boisterous social enjoyment, Paris OG is a must for heavy indica fans. Its waves of relaxation provide the perfect setting for letting go of worries and annoyances.\n"

        "description": "Blowfish is a sativa-leaning hybrid with a well-balanced high and a complex flavor profile. This strain owes its potency to G13, which according to some specious lore was created as a government-engineered mind control drug; it is a cross between an unnamed G13 and Carbon Funk hybrid and another unnamed G13 and Blue Dot hybrid. The chefs behind this delicacy are Dutch Flowers, the same breeders who have produced flavorful hybrid Chocolate Thai. Blowfish’s even-handed high tapers into a stoney, full-body relaxation that’s as good for relieving pain as it is for unwinding. Its potency has been measured at between 20% and 26% THC.Blowfish has small, relatively unimpressive flowers. The are small to medium in size and cling together in small, pebbly formations. The buds have the dense, tightly-packed structure characteristic of indicas. Leaves are olive green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. If there is anything notable about these flowers, it’s their resin -- the inner and outer surfaces of the leaves are studded with milky white trichomes that account for Blowfish’s psychoactivity.What Blowfish lacks in looks, it makes up for with a crowd-pleasing tropical citrus aroma. The smell of pineapple mingles with some tangy orange. On closer inspection, there are also some rich, incense-like base notes. Breaking or grinding up the flowers gives off a hint of pepper, tickling the back of the palate. When combusted, Blowfish gives off a pungent, acrid smoke that may trigger coughing. This harsh smoke finishes with a sour-sweet citrus flavor on the exhale.The high from Blowfish mounts slowly, sometimes taking several minutes after users have toked before it lifts them into an engaged, cerebral mindset. Thoughts may wander from one to the next, but this strain is without the intense, racing feeling that can come with more pure sativas. In the right set and setting, users will relax and settle into their surroundings, getting lost in thoughts as the world recedes into the background. Some users also feel an increased sociability, sometimes to the point of giddiness and euphoria. As the high wears on, Blowfish’s sedative indica side kicks in. The ensuing blend of mental and physical effects can be a great way to enjoy activities that involve both mind and body, like exercise, dancing, and even sex. But just like eating the wrong part of a Japanese fugu blowfish can kill you, smoking too much of this Blowfish can tip you over into couch-lock or a deep, heavy sleep. Because of the sleepy vibes on its backend, Blowfish is best enjoyed in the late afternoon or early evening.Blowfish has several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its anti-inflammatory properties can be good for anything from headaches to chronic pain. Its initial sense of focus can also be of aid to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to sustain concentration on a single task. Psychologically speaking, Blowfish can temporarily dull the acute symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Because of its sativa onset, Blowfish comes with the risk of paranoia; those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume with caution.Dutch Flowers has made seeds of Blowfish available for sale online. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for warm and semi-humid climates. Its hardy genetics (its producers brag that it has unique breeding stock, with “no White Widow, Northern Lights, Skunk or Blueberry in its composition”) make it more resistant to disease than many other varieties. Blowfish flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when cultivated indoors and gives growers a high yield for their efforts. Those who take the time to grow Blowfish should also take the time to properly cure their buds by first hanging them upside-down for one week in 70-degree surroundings with consistent 50% humidity and then sealing them in airtight containers stored at 60-65% humidity.Blowfish’s versatile high makes it a solid choice for everything from taking an extended hike to lounging around on a rainy day. If you happen to break it out in social situations, be prepared to share, as its pleasant aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

This strain was developed by Delicious Seeds -- the same breeders responsible for Cotton Candy Kush -- and is a cross between Black Domina and the pungent White Russian. Black Russian offers a sleepy, relaxing high and a pleasantly tropical aroma. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured its potency at anywhere from 12% to a whopping 26% THC.Flowers of Black Russian are visually impressive -- medium to large in size and very colorful. The buds have the densely-packed structure typically associated with indica varieties. The curly leaves are mossy green and are threaded through with a high volume of hairy yellow pistils. Phenotypes of Black Russian also frequently display shades of purple, ranging from pale lavender to a deep violet. These purple hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, these already-vibrant flowers are coated with dewy trichomes, making them very sticky to the touch.When properly cured, Black Russian can give off a whole array of fruity, tropical aromas. A citrus tang mingles with notes of berry and pineapple to give an overall sweet impression. On closer inspection, there are also some distinctly earthy, skunky notes passed on from parent strain Black Domina. Despite this pleasant aromatic profile, Black Russian burns with a harsh smoke when combusted and may trigger some coughing or watery eyes. On the exhale, the rich smoke has a sweet berry taste accented by a bit of spice and skunk.Black Russian offers what might be described as a creeper of a high, taking several minutes after smokers have savored its taste before effects take hold. Eventually, users will notice a faint tingle in the face and extremities, accompanied by a mounting heaviness in the limbs. As deep breathing happens more easily, tension and stress may evaporate. Smokers may also detect an uptick in mood or an increased appreciation of their surroundings. While this strain may not bring about an intense, analytical mindset, it may sharpen the senses, amplifying sights, sounds, and even tastes. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock may take over. This is decidedly a strain best enjoyed at night -- in its later stages, Black Russian can leave its users foggy and spaced-out.Black Russian’s stoney properties can also have application for medical cannabis patients. It can serve to temporarily numb the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even PTSD. Analgesic effects can relieve chronic aches and pains while anti-inflammatory effects may take care of everyday annoyances like headaches or indigestion. In high enough doses, Black Russian can even overcome insomnia, lulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Because it does not tend to encourage intense, recursive thinking, this strain may be a good choice for people who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Delicious has made seeds of Black Russian available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Whatever its growing environment, this bud may show some natural resistance to mold and mildew. Plants grow short and bushy with wide lateral branches. Growers should be sure to “top” their crops by tripping any broad, light-blocking fan leaves; this can encourage the proliferation of any flowering nodes growing on lower branches. Those looking to bring out the strain’s bold purple streaks should also expos the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Black Russian flowers within a short 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid September when grown outdoors. It offers a modest yield of about 42 grams (or 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.More of a passive indoor strain, Black Russian is great for unwinding after a long day of work. It’s as enjoyable when shared with friends as it is when toked solo for a lazy, therapeutic evening. If you do break it out in a crowd, though, bring enough to share -- its sweet tropical fumes are bound to attract some attention.\n"

It was developed by Gage Green Group, the Dutch producers who have also stabilized tasty favorite Grape Stomper. Blackberry has two potent parents: Blackberry Widow, created by the prolific Jojorizo and Crystal Locomotive, a strong blend of White Widow and Trainwreck. Blackberry Pie can be enjoyed in a variety of settings and is sure to impress even veteran cannabis users with its potency. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured its THC levels at between 14% and 19%.Blackberry Pie’s attractive flowers are the first sign of its bag appeal. The buds cling together in a dense, clustered formation that looks similar to actual blackberries. The mossy green leaves are tangled with dark red pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain also have large patches of purple, the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics being stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Cloudy white trichomes cap off these eye-catching buds -- after all, both parent strains have notoriously resinous White Widow in their background. When properly cured, Blackberry Pie has a sweet and fruity profile. The aroma of blueberries (rather than blackberries) predominates. It is grounded out by a more danky, woodsy scent. Meanwhile, breaking up or grinding the dense nugs yields a hashy, incense-like odor. Blackberry Pie burns with a very smooth smoke and tastes like berries with a hint of pine on the exhale. This Notably, there are no detectable grape flavors -- this is because the anthocyanin pigments that dictate this strain’s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.The high from Blackberry Pie comes on slowly, beginning as a faint pressure around the eyes and temples. Within a few minutes, smokers may detect some changes in their perception -- sights, sounds, and even smells may take on new dimensions. Visual distortions may also be common. These early psychedelic effects can be a fun way to enjoy trippy movies or music. For some, these mental effects may also manifest as a creative or analytical mindset.

Because of its initially intense cerebral effects, those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume with caution and moderation.Gage Green has made seeds of Blackberry Pie available for sale online. This hardy strain has landrace roots from Afghanistan, Mexico, and Thailand, making it a particularly stable crop and good choice for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s purple potential expose the plants to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blackberry Pie flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Growers should also preserve Blackberry Pie’s distinctive flavor and high resin production via a two-stage process called curing. Curing requires the freshly-trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for one week in 70-degree surroundings with consistent 50% humidity. Once sufficiently dry to the touch, the buds should then be sealed in airtight containers and stored in slightly more moist conditions of 60-65% humidity; as they cure, buds should be checked regularly for mold or mildew.Somewhat difficult to come by, Blackberry Pie is worth picking up for its combination of physical and mental effects.

        "description": "Black Mamba is an intense sativa with impressive flowers and long-lasting, mind-bending effects. It was created by Snow High Seeds, a breeder who experiments with crossing unique landrace strains. Black Mamba itself is a cross between two very rare landraces: a Vietnamese and a Black Congolese, both of which are sativas. The result is a flavorful and very potent strain that’s bound to impress even cannabis veterans. Black Mamba’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 13% and 25% THC.Black Mamba’s flowers are immediately identifiable by their incredibly dark flowers. The curly leaves are a dusky shade of forest green and, more often than not, exhibit patches of deep purple in almost equal proportion. The latter color is the result of exceptionally high levels of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics; when agitated by cold weather during the growing period, these pigments produce purple hues in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. These colorful buds cling together in puffy, almost spherical clusters that are small to medium in size. Cloudy white trichomes dot the flowers, making them difficult to break up without a grinder.Black Mamba also has a memorable aroma to match its eye-catchings buds. When properly cured, the flowers emit a sour-sweet, grape-like scent that invites consumers to take repeated whiffs. Rich base notes of pine emerge on closer inspection, giving the strain an earthy profile. Grinding up or breaking apart the buds yields a more herbal smell. When burnt, Black Mamba gives off a smooth smoke that tastes like sweet grape juice on the exhale. Notably, the strain’s purple color and grape taste are entirely incidental; while its color is determined by pigments, its flavor profile is dictated by compounds called terpenes. Finally, this can be a very pungent smoke -- those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.The high from Black Mamba hits hard and fast, initially manifesting as a pressure in the forehead and around the temples. Smokers may feel their powers of perception suddenly shift to pick up on external stimuli that might otherwise go unnoticed. Not only do sights and sounds seem more intense; smokers may also take increased stock of their own thoughts, which can jump around quickly in rapid association. This mind race can lead many to become talkative and social, more willing to engage with those around them. When used in isolation, Black Mamba can produce the energy needed to accomplish tasks like cleaning, organizing, or running errands. It can also set the stage for users to pore over deep philosophical or analytical questions. At its heights, this strain may induce trippy, almost hallucinogenic effects that can be enjoyable for seasoned smokers but may plunge newbies into panic or paranoia. Black Mamba is definitely a strain to enjoy during the day, as its energetic vibes are likely to leave users wide-eyed and red.Black Mamba has a few benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can help those with mild to moderate cases of stress and depression to spend some time more consciously and mindfully. It may also help those with attention deficit disorders to maintain a clearheaded and lucid focus. This strain can also relieve the painful intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. As noted, Black Mamba’s strong sativa genetics can contribute to some intense, recursive thinking. As a result, it is not appropriate for those who are prone to panic or anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Snow High has made seeds of Black Mamba available online. Its pure sativa lineage means that its plants can grow very tall and may not fare well indoors. In order to be cultivated outdoors, the strain requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70-80 degree Fahrenheit range. Black Mamba also has an extremely long flowering time, almost unheard of in domestic cannabis breeding -- it is ready for harvest after 13 to 14 weeks. For their patience, Black Mamba offers its growers a heavy yield of flowers.A true connoisseur's strain, Black Mamba is best enjoyed in a set and setting in which the user feels totally comfortable. It’s especially fun when shared with friends who can appreciate this cerebral, elevated experience right along with you.\n"

        "description": "Black Ice is typically a dangerous phenomenon to watch out for when walking or driving -- but the cannabis strain Black Ice offers no such nasty surprises. Black Ice is a primarily indica hybrid created by Spanish producers The Moon Seeds. It is a cross between Black Domina and the notorious White Widow and has a dank, earthy aroma alongside a heavy sedative high. This strain’s potency has been measured at between 19% and 24% THC.Black Ice is marked by small to medium-sized nuggets of densely-packed leaves. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Frequently, phenotypes of this strain also have patches of dark purple in their leaves; these hues come about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics are stimulated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Finally, Black Ice has a thick coating of white trichomes that rivals even the resin production of parent strain White Widow. These trichomes make the buds super-sticky to the touch and give them a slight white sheen, perhaps inspiring the “ice” in this strain’s name.The smell of sour-sweet, overripe berries wafts up from cured buds of Black Ice. The flowers also have some musky, earthy undertones that keep their aroma from being overly sweet and tangy. Grinding or breaking up the leaves yields some notes of black pepper and incense, likely the influence of Afghani in the strain’s genetics. When combusted, Black Ice burns with a very smooth, rich smoke that has a dank acrid, taste on the exhale. A slight floral aftertaste may also be evident.Black Ice offers what can be described as a creeper of a high, sometimes taking several minutes before its effects can be detected. A tingle in the upper face and extremities may be barely perceptible at first, becoming louder and louder until smokers’ faces morph into permanent smiles. Users may also feel any muscular tension dissipate as breathing happens more slowly and deeply.Black Ice’s high mostly impacts the body, only affecting the mind insofar as it slows down thoughts, putting users into a dopey and dreamy state of mind. The strain is a great accompaniment to passive activities like binge-watching or listening to some trippy, immersive music. As this sedative highs wears on or as dosage is increased, smokers may feel themselves slowly and pleasantly melting into their surroundings. It way go without saying, then, that Black Ice is best enjoyed at night. Finally, many users describe this strain’s high as relatively short, at less than 2 hours.Medical cannabis users can also find value in Black Ice’s relaxing effects. It can be an effective way to temporarily numb the distracting symptoms of stress and depression. It can also soothe aches and pains of all kinds. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory properties may counteract everyday discomforts like headaches and indigestion. As noted, Black Ice can also relax its users to the point of immobility, making it a potential treatment for insomnia. Because of its relative lack of intense, cerebral effects, this may also be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Humid The Moon has made seeds of Black Ice available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out; while outdoor cultivation typically requires humid climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the stable Northern Lights and Afghani genes in this strain’s lineage may make it more resistant to adverse outdoor conditions like temperature variations. Plants of Black Ice have a characteristically indica silhouette, with a short and bushy stature and strong lateral branches. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s eye-catching purple hues should expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures. Black Ice flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors.Although it’s not the best strain to savor if you have a busy day ahead of you, Black Ice works perfectly as a fruity treat at the end of the day. Its sky-high resin production also makes this a good strain for making hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Black Haze is a sativa-leaning hybrid with a strong landrace background. It combines Colombian Black, Colombian Gold, and Purple Haze genetics to yield a fruity flavor and an active high. It is the creation of Pioneer Nuggets, a Washington state based breeder that supplies dispensaries throughout the Pacific Northwest. The “black” in this strain’s name refers to the dark purple, almost black color of its leaves. Not to be outdone by the flowers themselves, the high from this strain is strong and long-lasting. Its potency has been measured at between 14% and 22% THC.Flowers of Black Haze are striking in their dissimilarity to many other buds. They are medium to large in size and have an elongated shape. Rather than densely-packed, the leaves appear fluffy and wispy and can be torn away easily from their central stems. Most surprisingly, Black Haze’s leaves are more purple than green; these striking violet hues are a byproduct of a very high concentration of pigments (called anthocyanins) in the plant’s genetics. Similar to the process by which depleted chlorophyll levels can create fiery red, orange, and yellow displays in autumn foliage, these anthocyanins cause cannabis leaves to reveal varying shades of blue and purple when stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Black Haze’s already-colorful buds are shot through with fiery red pistils and are coated with sticky, translucent white trichomes.On initial inspection, buds of Black Haze have a woodsy aroma, redolent of pine and cedar. The Haze in this strain’s background also lends a perky herbal character, somewhat like potpourri. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers gives off some dank and earthy notes, redolent of leather. Black Haze has a smooth smoke when burnt. Its Haze lineage really comes through on the exhale, leaving behind an earthy and slightly floral taste.Despite its somewhat sinister name, Black Haze’s fast acting high is anything but intimidating. Within relatively little time, users may notice an uptick in mood which, in the right set and setting, can bloom into euphoria. Smokers may also sense that their powers of perception are sharper; sights, sounds, and even tastes can take on intense new dimensions. As the high wears on, Black Haze’s indica influence may become more apparent. However, these relaxing effects serve more to moderate the smoker’s newly-active thoughts than to impart any kind of heavy body stone. The clearheaded focus that persists throughout the high makes Black Haze great for tackling creative projects as well as finding analytical solutions to problem-oriented scenarios. Sedation and couch-lock are rarely reported, meaning that Black Haze is best enjoyed as an afternoon or a wake-and-bake strain.Medical cannabis patients also find a variety of uses with this strain. Its mood-altering effects can temporarily relieve the acute symptoms of stress or depression. Its sustained sense of focus may be an aid to patients with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically, Black Haze may be an effective means of relief from chronic aches and pains. Although Black Haze is less cerebrally intense than other sativa strains, it may still tip over into paranoia or mind race for some. As a result, cannabis newcomers or those who are prone to panic should consume this strain with caution and moderation.Additionally, there are some phenotypes of Black Haze in circulations that have a high CBD content but a lower THC index; these varieties have little to no psychoactivity, but they amplify the calming and pain-relieving effects so valued by medical cannabis patients. Seeds of Black Haze are available from several digital retailers. Once obtained, this unique strain can be grown indoors or out. If cultivated outdoors, plants call for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 72 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range; that said, this strain’s stable landrace genes may make its plants more resistant to temperature variations. Although Black Haze may not need much help to produce its trademark purple leaves, growers should accelerate the process, stimulating anthocyanins by exposing plants to cold weather late in the vegetative stage.Black Haze is a clear choice for social situations -- it’s a great choice for enjoying the great outdoors with friends or simply shooting the breeze at home. If you do bring this strain out in public, be sure to bring enough to share, as its singular aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Black Diamond is a hybrid with mostly indica genetics. It is a cross between flavor-engineered Blackberry and Diamond OG, a hybrid derived from OG Kush. This strain delivers a strong, sedative high that still allows for mental lucidity, making it great for concentration and conversation. Aside from its psychoactive potency, Black Diamond also has definite bag appeal, with multicolored flowers and a dynamic, robust aroma. This indica’s THC index has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Black Diamond sets itself apart with medium to large flowers that have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. The buds have the dense, solid structure characteristic of other indica varieties. Leaves are a pale sage green and are shot through with pale brown pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain also have vibrant streaks of purple, which are the result of pigments called anthocyanins that have been stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Icy white trichomes are the crowning glory on these striking flowers, giving them a very sticky texture and making them difficult to make them break up by hand.When properly cured, Black Diamond has a rich berry aroma passed on from parent strain Blackberry. On closer inspection, these is also an underlying dank and earthy character. Meanwhile, breaking up or grinding the buds gives off a nutty, toasted odor. When burnt, Black Diamond gives off a surprisingly smooth smoke for an indica; on the exhale, this smoke leaves behind the taste of oak and berries. Notably, Black Diamond has no detectable grape flavor -- this is because the pigments that bring out the leaves’ purple hues do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.Black Diamond’s high sets in relatively quickly with a weightiness in the core and limbs, leading smokers to seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. Consumers may find themselves more relaxed and able to breathe more deeply and easily. There are also some subtle mental effects that can lead to amplified sounds as well as visual distortions. Such trippy vibes can be great for watching TV or listening to some immersive, atmospheric music. Black Diamond can also make even experienced cannabis users giddy -- extended fits of giggling are not uncommon. Throughout all this stimulation, a strong body stone persists, making smokers unlikely to engage in active pursuits like exercise or even house cleaning. That said, because of its ability to affect both body and mind, Black Diamond can serve as an effective aphrodisiac. Because it is more sedative than energetic, Black Diamond is perhaps best enjoyed in the evening or just before bed when its slow burn of relaxation can be fully appreciated.Black Diamond also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its strong, almost narcotic feeling of sedation can effectively numb aches and pains, whether temporary as due to injury or chronic as due to diseases like arthritis or lupus. Its mellow euphoria may also take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, anxiety, and depression. Finally, Black Diamond can be an antidote for insomnia, pulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Because the frantic feeling of “mind race” is not often reported with this strain, it can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or paranoia.No breeders have made seeds of Black Diamond available for commercial sale. Instead, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Plants grow short and bushy and should be “topped,” or trimmed of any wide fan leaves in order to encourage the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches. Those looking to bring out Black Diamond’s striking purple hues should also expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins.With its social, easygoing character, Black Diamond can be an excellent way to enhance your apres-ski experience (or to get it started early while the rest of your friends hit the slopes). As enjoyable in group settings, it can also set the ideal mood for some quality solo time.\n"

        "description": "Alien Genetics offers us another potent hybrid with Alien Rock Candy, an indica-leaning cross between Sour Dubble and Tahoe Alien. This dank and funky strain offers a supremely well-balanced high that can be a great catalyst for creativity. With a mellow indica slide into relaxation on the backend, this is also the perfect strain for unwinding at the end of the day.Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found this strain to have THC levels between 16% and 18%.Flowers of Alien Rock Candy are not very visually impressive: the buds are small and dense and cling together in popcorn-like formations. The tightly-bunched leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. Plentiful trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, giving them a silvery sheen and a very sticky texture; in fact, Alien Rock Candy's high resin production makes it particularly valuable in the production of hash.Alien Rock Candy is named for a crystallized, super-saccharine treat and this strain certainly has a cloyingly sweet odor. The smell of citrus predominates, grounded out by a dank, earthy musk. Breaking up or grinding the buds releases some palate-tickling sour notes, passed on from grandparent strain Sour Diesel. When combusted, Alien Rock Candy's smoke can be harsh and eye-watering, often inducing coughing. On the exhale, it has an herbal, lemony taste, reminiscent of a good cup of aromatic tea.Alien Rock Candy offers a creeper of a high, often taking several minutes to reveal its effects. It begins with a pressure around the temples, accompanied by an increase in cerebral activity. Users may find themselves more acutely perceptive and may become tuned into ideas or external stimuli that might otherwise seem uninteresting. As smokers adjust to this altered state, they may find themselves ready to tackle mundane tasks or even complex problem-solving scenarios. Eventually, Alien Rock Candy's indica side emerges with gradually heavier waves of relaxation moving down from the neck and breaking along the core and limbs. Increasing one's dosage will amp up this strain's sedation and leave you couch-locked while still mentally stimulated, content to contemplate deep questions and concepts or simply to daydream. Because this strain has a slow onset, smokers should moderate their intake accordingly, waiting a few minutes before toking again. Alien Rock Candy's high is also said to be long-lasting, even for seasoned cannabis consumers. This versatile bud is best enjoyed in the early evening, when its slow body melt can be fully appreciated.Alien Rock Candy can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its consistent lucidity can be helpful for patients with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on single tasks. It can also temporarily take the edge off of moderate cases of stress, anxiety, and depression, helping users to spend their time more mindfully. The strain's heavy indica sedation can also relieve aches and pains, both temporary and long-term. Finally, because it can stoke hunger, it is useful for those who have lost their appetites to strong medications or treatments. Because Alien Rock Candy's cerebral energy is balanced out by its bodily effects, it may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for prospective growers, Alien Genetics has made seeds of Alien Rock Candy available for sale online. It is a forgiving strain for newcomers to cannabis cultivation and it can be successfully grown indoors or out (although outdoor growing requires a humid, Mediterranean-like climate). Growers should top their plants, trimming away any obstructive fan leaves in order to let light and air reach any low-growing flowering nodes. This strain flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers. It can also be a particularly pungent grow; growers who are concerned with keeping their operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Alien Rock Candy's mellow, middle-of-the-road qualities make it great for gregarious social activities like camping and partying. It can also be a great way to spend some introspective time alone and get in touch with your spiritual side.\n"

        "description": "Narnia is a bold, richly-flavored hybrid whose mind-bending effects will have you exploring your house for secret passages to another world. This strain capitalizes on some world-class genetics: it’s a cross between classic hybrid Jack Herer and potent sativa Trainwreck. Created by Soul Shine Cannabis -- Washington state-based breeders who have created inventive strains like Himalayan Blackberry -- Narnia has an upbeat sativa energy that makes it a great daytime smoke. Narnia’s potency has been measured at between 19% and 25% THC.Narnia’s medium-sized flowers cling together in popcorn-like formations and hold a dense, indica-typical bud structure. The tightly curled leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with vibrant yellow pistils. Glassy white trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of the buds, making this strain very sticky and particularly difficult to break up without the convenience of a grinder.When cured properly, flowers of this strain have the unique combination of fruit and spice that makes parent strain Jack Herer so popular. On first inspection, the buds have a simultaneously spicy and citric aroma, much like an orange studded with cloves. Although citrus is the primary smell, Narnia also has some sweet berry notes hanging out underneath. Meanwhile, breaking up or grinding the nugs yields a distinctly hashy scent. When burnt, Narnia gives off smoke that is rich and lung-expanding, but surprisingly smooth. On the exhale, it leaves behind the lingering tastes of pine and sugar -- the overall impression is similar to sap or maple syrup.Narnia’s effects are immediately obvious, taking hold as a bracing pressure around the eyes and temples. Perception of external stimuli may be significantly altered, resulting in some visual distortions or even slight auditory hallucinations. This sensory enhancement can be a great way to enjoy some of your favorite foods, as taste can also take on an entirely new dimension. Many fans of the strain also report an uptick in cerebral activity, characterized by freely-associative thinking and stimulating conversation. As users adjust to this altered state, they may find themselves in a suddenly euphoric and sociable state. Narnia’s burst of energy persists for the duration of the high. Users may find the motivation needed to plow through a lengthy to-do list. Some may even use the strain as an accompaniment for a trip to the gym. A quintessential wake-and-bake variety, Narnia may not be the best choice for use just before bed, as it can leave smokers especially wired.Narnia may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. While it has some anti-inflammatory properties that can be good for anything from headaches to nausea, uses are primarily psychological. The strain can be a good treatment for mild to moderate cases of stress and depression, temporarily distracting patients from their troubling symptoms and helping them to spend time more consciously and mindfully. Its sustained sense of focus can also aid those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on single tasks. Because of the potential for mindrace and stressful recursive thinking in the early stages of its high, Narnia may not be the best choice for those who are prone to panic or anxiety. Breeders Soul Shine have not released seeds of Narnia for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers of the strain will need to obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical clones. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. There is limited information available on best growing practices for Narnia, but we know that both of its parent strains can grow tall and spindly, especially in the flowering stage -- growers can keep crop heights manageable by trimming and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage. We also know that parent strains have a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.Although very popular in the Pacific Northwest, Narnia may be difficult to find elsewhere. If spotted, it’s worth picking up as much for its energizing and motivating effects as for its unique herbal flavor profile. Although a hybrid, this strain may be particularly attractive to sativa fans who can use it to socialize, work, or even enjoy the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "Pink Panties is a scandalously-named strain with a mysterious backstory. It is believed to be a cross between a Burmese landrace strain and a Florida Kush plant that was then backcrossed with another Florida Kush plant. The Cookie Fam, a San Francisco-based group of breeders who claim responsibility for originating Girl Scout Cookies, also take credit for the creation of Pink Panties.  Because of the high representation of landraces in this strain’s genetics -- in addition to the Burmese Kush in its background, parent strain Florida Kush is itself descended from none other than Hindu Kush -- Pink Panties is very potent and can be especially an especially hardy grow.Buds of Pink Panties are medium to large and have the dense, solid bud structure typical of indica varieties. The leaves, which coil tightly around their central stems, are a dark mossy green. Hairy pistils thread their way through the leaves and can range from pale orange to a shocking shade of pink, granting this strain its name. Certain phenotypes of Pink Panties also have the odd patch of purple in their leaves, the result of anthocyanin pigments being stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Milky-white trichomes cover the flowers and make them very sticky and hard to break up without a quality grinder.When properly cured, buds of Pink Panties emit an aroma that blends fresh flowers with the tang of grapefruit. On closer inspection, there are also some astringent notes of ammonia, possibly due to the influence of grandparent strain Chemdawg. Despite its complex flavor profile, Pink Panties delivery a very smooth smoke when burnt. It has a citrus and lightly herbal taste on the exhale; the overall impression is similar to that of a floral liqueur.Pink Panties offers a slow, creeping high that may take several minutes after users have finished smoking to feel its initial effects. What begins as a slow pressure around the eyes and temples may mount into drooping eyelids and a permasmile. This weighty feeling is soon matched by a heaviness in the core and limbs -- a feeling that may lead users to seek comfort in the closest possible surroundings. Mental effects are subtle and may take the form of visual distortions or a freely-associative kind of daydreaming. Such trippy effects can lay the groundwork for a lazy afternoon of watching movies or listening to music. As time wears on or as dosage is increased, smokers may become contentedly couch-locked. Because of its predominantly sleepy vibes, Pink Panties is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or evening.Medical cannabis patients also find value in this strain’s powerful but functional sedation. It can temporarily blunt the symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. It may also work on the body, soothing aches and pains whether they’re short term or chronic. In high enough doses, it can even counteract stubborn cases of insomnia. Because it does not often lead to recursive cerebral thinking or paranoia, Pink Panties may be a good option for smokers who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Perhaps because of its murky point of origin, seeds of Pink Panties have not yet been made available for sale online. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of strain in order to grow clones. It can be grown indoors or out; successful outdoor cultivation typically calls for humid climates with 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit daytime temperatures, but Pink Panties’ solid landrace genetics may be able to withstand some degree of temperature variation. Furthermore, the strain’s indica-leaning qualities suggest that, like its descendant Sunset Sherbet, Pink Panties grows short and bushy. As such, growers should be sure to “top” their plants -- that is, trim away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves to encourage the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches. Finally, those looking to bring out Pink Panties’ full purple bag appeal should expose the plants to colder than average nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Pink Panties is a great choice for mellow solo or social use. If you do break it out in public, though, bring enough to share as this strain’s unique scent is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Emerald OG is an indica-dominant hybrid with a thoroughly relaxing high. This strain comes from the offspring of Fire OG and Emerald Diesel that was then backcrossed with another male Fire OG plant. Created by a collective known as the California Breeders Assoc, Emerald OG has a mild and fruity flavor profile that’s sure to be a crowd-pleaser. Emerald OG’s potency has been measured at between 17% and an impressive 22%.Emerald OG sets itself apart with thick, dense buds that have a tapered, almost bullet-like shape. The tightly-curled leaves are a bright shade of spring green and have a high volume of rust-colored hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from male fertilizing plants. Some phenotypes of this strain also show off flashes of purple in their leaves. These latter hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process; the mechanism is similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. Cloudy white trichomes blanket these already-colorful flowers, giving them a slightly silver sheen. Trichomes also make this strain very sticky and difficult to break up without a grinder.Despite the OG Kush in Emerald OG’s background, it is surprisingly devoid of dank, skunky odors. When properly cured, the flowers have a fresh floral aroma, accented by a hint of sweet fruit. Getting in close as buds are ground up will reveal more of the earthy, musky character more often associated with the Kush family. When combusted, Emerald OG burns with a smooth (albeit rich and lung-expanding) smoke. On exhale, it leaves behind the tangy taste of citrus mixed with some notes of damp soil.Emerald OG’s high creeps up slowly. Although it may go unnoticed at first, eventually, it creates a feeling of warmth that spreads down from the neck and through the core. Smokers may find that they’re able to breathe more deeply and easily at the same time as their stresses and tensions slowly dissipate. Even though Emerald OG allows users to bend this relaxing high to their will and remain active and mobile, they may be more comfortable lounging and passively engaging with their surroundings. If they opt for remaining horizontal, consumers may still be able to converse and and think logically (if they so desire). As dosage is increased, this strain can bring about an intractable couch-lock that serves as the perfect back group for daydreaming or working on creative projects For these reasons, Emerald OG is perhaps best enjoyed in the evening or at night. Furthermore, because of its slow onset, smokers may want to wait a while before upping their consumption.Emerald OG’s sedation has benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can numb aches and pains, whether they’re incidental as due to injury or chronic as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. This strain also has anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe headaches or upset stomachs. Psychologically speaking, it may offers some temporary relief from the acute symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Because it does not often lead to a disorienting feeling of mind race, Emerald OG may be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.The California Breeders Association sells seeds of Emerald OG online. Although there is little information available on ideal cultivation practices, we do know that it can be grown indoors or out -- although successful outdoor growing calls for a humid, Mediterranean-like climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. This strain may also grow tall, especially during its flowering stage, and should be trained early on through pruning and trimming to fit in smaller indoor spaces. Furthermore, growers looking to bring out Emerald OG’s eye-catching purple hues should expose plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. For an indica, this strain has a particularly long flowering period -- it is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors.Although it may not whisk you off to the land of Oz, Emerald OG is sure to take the edge off of a stressful day. It’s as fun when you’re cozy at home as it is when you’re out in comfortable and familiar surroundings.\n"

        "description": "Appalachia is a pungent hybrid with a strong sativa edge. Although its name refers to the mountainous region of the Eastern United States, Appalachia was developed in Colorado by High and Lonesome Seeds. This full-bodied strain is a cross between the notorious Green Crack and the Afghani-descended Tres Dawg. It has a skunky bouquet and imparts a perky, alert mindset. Appalachia’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 16% and 21% THC.Flowers of Appalachia impress with their large size and elongated shape. The buds have more of a sativa structure with fluffy, somewhat ragged-looking leaves that can be easily torn from their central stems. The leaves are a dull, muted shade of green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Translucent white trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, making Appalachia a very difficult strain to break up without the use of a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Appalachia have the striking scent of overripe fruit. This simultaneously sweet and skunky aroma, with notes of citrus, is reminiscent of parent strain Green Crack. On closer inspection, the flowers have a mellow, piney odor as well. Meanwhile, breaking up or grinding the buds yields some hashy, incense-like notes, leaving no doubt as to Appalachia’s Afghani landrace lineage. When burnt, this strain gives off a surprisingly smooth smoke that tastes skunky and faintly herbal on the exhale.Appalachia makes itself known quickly, hitting smokers between the eyes with a bracing pressure that may verge on throbbing, Eyelids may droop as mouths curl upwards into smiles. As users adjust to these disorienting effects, they may find that their sensory perception is sharper: sight and sounds may take on new dimensions. Furthermore, an analytical mindset may take over. Smokers may find value in thoughts or concepts otherwise deemed uninteresting. This mental acuity can be a great way to tackle both problem solving scenarios and creative projects. A feeling of euphoria may also persist, making smokers want to socialize and engage in free-flowing conversation. Appalachia has very few physical effects and couchlock is not commonly reported. For this reason, it is a good choice for energizing morning or afternoon use.Appalachia’ sativa-leaning properties have many uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Physiologically, its anti-inflammatory effects can ease everything from headaches to nausea. Psychologically, it may take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression, helping the afflicted to spend their time more consciously and deliberately. It can also help patients with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. Because Appalachia’s sativa side can bring about a disorienting feeling of mindrace in its early stages, it is not recommended for people who may be prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial-scale breeders have made seeds of Appalachia available for sale online. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. Like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a warm and semi-humid climate with consistent daylight. Although there is limited information available on best practices for growing this strain, we know that parent strain Green Crack can grow very tall and spindly, especially during the flowering period. This height can be managed in limited indoor spaces by trimming and pruning branches early on in the vegetative stage.Growers should be sure to preserve Appalachia’s unique flavor through a two-stage process called curing. Curing first requires freshly-trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for a week in 70-degree surroundings with consistent 50% humidity. Once sufficiently dry to the touch, the buds should be sealed in airtight containers and stored in slightly more moist conditions of 60-65% humidity; as they cure, buds should regularly be checked for mold or mildew.Whether you’re hiking in West Virginia or lounging on a beach in California, Appalachia is a great strain for striking off into the great outdoors and enjoying what nature has to offer. Alternatively, it can be great for working through a to-do list or simply winding down after a long day of work.\n"

        "description": "Megalodon is a sativa-dominant hybrid strain named for a prehistoric species of shark -- but there’s nothing extinct about this strain’s sky-high potency. It is a cross between three strains that produce notoriously high amounts of resin: White Widow, Snow White, and Great White Shark. The end product is a trippy, well-balanced smoke that’s right at home in a wide variety of settings. Its THC content has been measured at between 20% and 23% THC.Megalodon is marked by impressively large flowers. They are almost spherical in shape and adhere in a dense, tightly-packed bud structure. The tightly-coiled leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are threaded through with hairy golden-brown pistils. As might be expected of a strain descended from such high resin producers, Megalodon also has a dewy silver sheen as a result f its coating of translucent white trichomes. These incredibly sticky flowers are best broken up with a high-quality grinder and will leave behind a dusting of kief on any surfaces they touch.Usually a mild vegetal smell is a sign of poor curing techniques, but in Megalodon’s case, a grassy aroma is part and parcel of the strain’s genetics. This mellow scent is accented by some sharp, skunky notes. Grinding up or breaking up the buds yields a bit more character, with some notes of pepper and incense. When combusted, Megalodon gives off a smooth smoke. It leaves behind a nondescriptly herbal and vaguely skunky taste on the exhale. Some of this strain’s lack of pungency may be due to its high volume of trichomes; many varieties with a particularly high THC index (like The White, for example) may lack the rich mix of terpenes that contributes to a full-bodied and lasting flavor.Megalodon has a slow, creeping high that may require as much as 15 minutes to ramp up to its full effects. At first, smokers may feel a constricting pressure around the eyes and temples, accompanied by a slow tightening as their faces turn upwards into smiles. As they grow accustomed to these sensations, they’ll detect a newfound clarity of thought. Megalodon may bring about an exacting cerebral energy that is perfectly suited to situations involving problem solving or creative thinking. Thoughts may jump from one to another, making this a strain that is also excellent for conversing or socializing. Eventually, Megalodon’s indica side reveals itself: smokers may opt for the most comfortable surroundings possible as they feel their tensions dissipate. A trippy sense of time dilation may also become evident, with minutes seeming to pass much more slowly than before. That said, it is unlikely to put any but the most seasoned cannabis veterans to sleep. For this reason, Megalodon is perhaps best enjoyed in the early evening, when users can enjoy its full range of effects, tapering from initial energy down to stoney, full-body relaxation.Megalodon may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its early cerebral edge can have beneficial, uplifting effects for those suffering under stress or depression. This mentally-focused energy can also be a boon to patients with attention deficit disorders, helping them to sustain focus on a single task. Megalodon’s more sedative indica properties can also relieve deep-seated aches and pains and can take care of headaches and even migraines. Because the feeling of “mind race” associated with its onset can lead users to feel out of control, Megalodon may not be an ideal choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance. Seeds of Megalodon have not yet been made available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain cuttings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is limited information on ideal cultivation practices for this particular strain, it can be grown indoors or, in hot and semi-humid climates, outdoors. We also know that Megalodon’s sativa forebears can reach unmanageable heights during their flowering stages; those growing strain indoors should prune and trim its branches early in the vegetative stage in order to tame it.Megalodon’s versatility and potency make it great for anything from taking an extended sunny hike to cleaning the house on a rainy day. It’s sure to keep you revving along with its mammoth-sized psychoactivity.\n"

        "description": "Unlike its violent sea monster namesake, indica strain Godzilla is incredibly mellow and relaxing. It comes to us as a joint effort between Spain (a burgeoning European center of cannabis production and culture), Canada, and The Netherlands. Breeders Caña de España developed Godzilla from the potent genetics of the award-winning God Bud. Godzilla offers a fruity flavor profile alongside deep, long-lasting sedation. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured its THC content at between 15% and 18%.Godzilla’s flowers are certainly godzilla-sized. The buds are large and chunky and have the fluffy, almost ragged look of varieties that are more sativa-dominant. The loose leaves are a pale sea green and have a high volume of hairy orange pistils. As with parent strain God Bud, many phenotypes of Godzilla also have vibrant streaks of purple in their leaves; these latter colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Milky white trichomes also cover the buds, giving them a silvery sheen when viewed from a distance.Properly cured flowers of Godzilla have a complex aroma and taste. At first, consumers may notice the sweet tang of cherry and blueberry. On closer inspection, there are also distinct notes of vanilla. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the flowers yields an earthy, skunky odor, likely due to the presence of Skunk #1 in Godzilla’s lineage. Smoke is particularly smooth for an indica of this quality and leaves behind a fruity taste on the exhale, with a slight ammonia aftertaste. Notably, Godzilla has no discernible grape flavor even when its leaves appear purple; the pigments that determine the plant’s color have no corresponding effect on its taste.Godzilla takes effect slowly, gradually revealing itself with an increasingly weighty feeling in the core and limbs. After several minutes, smokers may feel as if they’ve transcended their surroundings and any lingering stressors. Tense muscles will loosen up and deep breathing can happen more easily. Cognition and logic, on the other hand, may take a backseat to a more hazy and dreamy mindset -- Godzilla is not the best choice for working your way through an intense to-do list. Many of the strain’s fans opt for maximum comfort when enjoying its heavy sedation. It is almost tailor-made for passive activities like listening to soft music or watching trippy movies. As the high wears on, Godzilla may be so effective at imparting relaxation that users may feel somewhat disconnected from their bodies as their thoughts wander; in high enough doses, the strain will simply lull users into a heavy sleep. More of a nighttime than a morning smoke, Godzilla has been described as lasting longer than average, even for more experienced smokers.Godzilla has several applications for medical cannabis users as well. Its lengthy sedation can soothe aches and pains -- whether they’re incidental as due to injury or chronic as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties can also take care of everyday discomforts like headaches or nausea. As noted, in high enough doses, Godzilla can even treat trenchant cases of insomnia. That said, because of its tendency to bring about a psychedelic mind-body separation, this strain may not be the best option for users who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Caña de España has conveniently made seeds of Godzilla available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or outdoors, although Caña specifically created the strain for humid, hot-weather climates; growers in northern latitudes may have some difficulty. The plants grow short and bushy, requiring growers to “top” them by trimming any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s full purple potential should expose the plant to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Godzilla flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors.Like Gorilla Glue and Golden Goat, Godzilla is one strain whose power lives up to its bestial name and reputation. It’s a great option for lounging and killing time, whether you’re alone or with some good friends.\n"

        "description": "For some, “sour patch” may conjure images of the tart, sticky candy -- but it also figures into the name of a powerhouse cannabis strain. Sour Patch Kiss is a cross between Sour Kush and Exotic Genetic’s sweet, biscuity Kimbo Kush. It was developed by Elev8 Seeds, the same breeders who have stabilized popular strains like Gorilla Cookies. Sour Patch Kiss offers a balanced (but slightly sativa-dominant) high alongside a funky berry taste. Its potency has been measured at between 21% and a whopping 31% THC.Sour Patch Kiss is marked by medium-sized flowers that hold the relatively loose, fluffy bud structure often associated with sativa varieties. The small and wispy leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are threaded through with pale brown and yellow hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants). Translucent, milky-white trichomes cover the buds, giving them a silver sheen and making them very difficult to break up by hand.When properly cured, flowers of Sour Patch Kiss give off the tangy aroma of fresh blueberries. Mixed with this burst of fruit is the mellow odor of pine and soil. A close inspection will also reveal some citrus sweetness, courtesy of Kimbo Kush. Breaking up or grinding the fluffy nugs yields the chemical stench of gasoline. When combusted, Sour Patch Kiss gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that can sting sinuses and cause eyes to water. On the exhale, this strain has the mouth-puckering taste of diesel fumes, leaving just a hint of sweet berry. This can be a pungent smoke; those looking to keep their toking discreet should take the necessary precautions.The high from Sour Patch Kiss is a bit of a creeper and may take a few minutes to take hold after smokers have recovered from the shock of its sour taste. Initial effects manifest as an enhanced awareness of one’s surroundings -- both visual and auditory stimuli may be somewhat enhanced or seem more interesting than they otherwise might. While some may find this altered perception alarming, experienced cannabis users can expect to settle into the slightly psychedelic high with some mellow music or a walk outdoors. Indeed, in the right set and setting, Sour Patch Kiss can provide the motivation needed to accomplish work, whether it’s cerebral and problem-oriented or more mundane and task-based. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, this strain’s sedative properties creep in and may provoke the desire to sit or lay down. Due to its energizing sativa onset, Sour Patch Kiss may leave smokers wired if they consume it at night; it’s best enjoyed during the morning or afternoon.Sour Patch Kiss also has several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its easygoing and productive vibes can temporarily help those struggling with mild to moderate stress or depression. It may also help those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus on the tasks in front of them. Sedative properties can soothe users’ aches and pains, while patients who have lost their appetites to disease or medication may find themselves suddenly hungry. Sour Patch Kiss is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance, as the force of its early cerebral effects can be overwhelming.Elev8 has made seeds of Sour Patch Kiss available online for prospective growers. It can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants can grow tall and may need to be pruned and trimmed back early in the vegetative stage in order to fit in smaller indoor spaces. Sour Patch Kiss flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, just as it can be pungent when burnt, its distinctive odor is pervasive during the growing process; growers should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Although its tart flavor profile can prove divisive, Sour Patch Kiss offers a versatile high that can be enjoyed in a variety of contexts. This strain’s attention-grabbing name could just backfire, though -- in 2016, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission banned 14 strains on the grounds that their names might appeal to children; if Sour Patch Kiss continues to gain popularity, it may find itself the target of a similar ban.\n"

        "description": "Grease Monkey is an indica-dominant hybrid from Exotic Genetix, the breeders who have given us standout strains like Kimbo Kush and Starfighter. Grease Monkey is a cross between the couch-locking indica Gorilla Glue and Exotic’s own hybrid Cookies and Cream. It imparts a thick and lazy body stone, while providing some subtle mental stimulation. Grease Monkey also carries the sweet and musky flavor profile that will be familiar to fans of strains in the Girl Scout Cookies family. Grease Monkey’s potency has been measured at between 16% and 30% THC.Grease Monkey’s buds have a characteristically indica appearance, with dense and solid buds of medium size. The flowers adhere in elongated, conical shapes. The leaves themselves appear pale green and are shot through with hairy, dark orange pistils. Perhaps most impressively, sticky white trichomes cling like frost to the inner and outer surfaces of the buds, accounting for this strain’s trippy effects and making it very difficult to break apart without the help of a grinder.Flowers of Grease Monkey give off an odor that is simultaneously sweet and skunky. The influence of Chemdawg and Sour Diesel -- by way of parent strain Gorilla Glue -- are clear in the astringent, fuel-like top notes. On closer inspection, a more complex sweetness becomes evident.Consumers may pick up on some creamy vanilla aromas, alongside a yeasty, bread-like base. Grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields a bit of spice and pepper, evidence of OG Kush in parent strain Girl Scout Cookies’ background. Grease Monkey gives off a smooth smoke when combusted; it tastes distinctly like vanilla with the clashing flavor of gasoline. Smokers looking to keep their consumption discreet should beware, as this can be a particularly pungent flower.Grease Monkey eases users into its high, starting with a faint pressure in the face, particularly around the eyes and temples. Within minutes, it radiates a warmth that spreads through the core and limbs, pulverizing lingering muscular tension. As they feel themselves relax, smokers may also notice that their powers of perception are also sharpened. External stimuli like sights or sounds may take on new dynamics. Furthermore, a cerebral mindset may take over, making users jump from one thought to the next. These trippy, thoughtful effects can lend themselves to free-flowing conversation or simply daydreaming. As the high wears on, Grease Monkey’s indica side takes over, pinning users in place and leading them to engage in more passive activities like watching TV or eating -- in fact, Grease Monkey has especially been known to stoke hunger. Although higher doses of the strain can pull users into a deep sleep, in average amounts, it is a good choice for morning or daytime use, providing a good balance of mental and physical effects.Just as it has many recreational uses, Grease Monkey also has a variety of applications for medical cannabis patients. It can be a balm for the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression, taking the edge off of patients’ frazzled day to day lives. Its sedative properties can also soothe aches and pains of all kinds, whether temporary or chronic. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory effects can prove to be an effective treatment for everyday discomforts like nausea. In high enough doses, Grease Monkey can counteract insomnia, lulling smokers into a deep and restful sleep. Because of the initial risk of out-of-control “mind race,” this strain may not be the best choice for patients who are prone to panic.Exotic Genetix has made seeds of Grease Monkey available online for those who wish to grow it themselves. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing environments should maintain constant humidity and daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants can grow tall, but can be kept at a manageable height if growers trim and prune branches early on in the vegetative stage. Grease Monkey flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers. This can also be a very stinky grow and those looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Better suited to a lazy day than a productive one, Grease Monkey is valued for its hazy and mellow properties. It’s great as a sweet treat to enjoy with either your morning coffee or your evening dessert.\n"

        "description": "Blueberry Blast is a sativa-dominant hybrid with a powerful cerebral high to match its bag appeal. Created by Snow High Seeds, the prolific Oregon-based breeders responsible for strains like Black Mamba, this strain is a cross between omnipresent Blue Dream and heavy, stoney Johnny Blaze. These genes combine to create a buzzy, energetic effect alongside a complex flavor profile. Its THC levels have been measured at between 16% and 28%.Blueberry Blast is marked by medium to large flowers that have a uniquely tapered, conical shape. The sizable buds adhere in a dense, heavy indica structure and breaking them apart calls for a quality grinder. The mossy green leaves are shot through with hairy orange pistils. Vibrant shades of purple are often present as well; these colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics are agitated by cold weather during vegetation -- the process is not unlike the changing of foliage in autumn due to declining chlorophyll levels. Translucent white trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers, contributing to the strain’s psychoactivity and giving the buds a sticky texture.True to its name, this variety hits consumers with a fruity blueberry blast as soon as it’s freed from its container. This aroma, verging on overly sweet, is underscored by some sharp citrus notes. Grinding up or breaking open the flowers gives off some musky and herbal notes, reminiscent of grandparent strain Haze. When combusted, Blueberry Blast gives off a smooth and easy smoke and may taste woodsy and piney on the exhale.Blueberry Blast offers a fast-acting high, often taking effect before smokers have even finished savoring its standout flavor. It launches smokers into an intense cerebral headspace in which thoughts jump from one to the next and external stimuli are particularly amplified. This mindset can manifest in a variety of ways, depending on the user’s set and settings. In social situations, it can lead to free-flowing conversations; during unscheduled solo time, it may inspire the user to plow through errands, cleaning, or even exercise. Alternatively, it can be a great way to appreciate favorite movies or albums with a freshly altered perspective. Blueberry Blast’s initial surge of energy gives way to some indica relaxation on the backend. These physical sensations, although soothing, are unlikely to bring about couch-lock, and the strain’s mental stimulation typically persists for the duration of the high. A quintessential wake-and-bake strain, Blueberry Blast is more appropriate for use during daylight, as its fast-paced effects are liable to keep smokers wired before bed.Blueberry Blast’s mental effects can have many psychological benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its tendency to bring about concentration and focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. Its bright and uplifting effects can also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Because of its tendency to bring about recursive, cerebral thinking, Blueberry Blast is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Although Snow High seems to have made seeds of Blueberry Blast available at one point, they may no longer be in stock for purchase. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a humid, Mediterranean-like climate with consistent daytime sunlight. Growers looking to bring out Blueberry Blast’s trademark purple highlights should also expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. As is typical of sativas, this variety has a long flowering time of about 9 to 12 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. After taking the time to nurture this strain, growers should also properly cure their plants by first drying them out for a week and then sealing them in airtight jars in surroundings of about 60% humidity.With all the zip of Haze (which is present on both sides of its lineage), Blueberry Blast is a great option for powering through a busy day. Its potent and long-lasting effects are sure to impress cannabis novices and veterans alike.\n"

Created by G13 Labs -- the European producers responsible for Blue OG and Royal Kush -- is a cross between two powerhouse strains: tasty Blueberry and the notoriously resinous White Widow. Blue Venom’s sting is sure to infect cannabis novices and veterans alike with a thorough and long-lasting sedation. Its THC content has been measured at between 12% and 23%.Flowers of Blue Venom impress with surprisingly large buds that have the tight, dense bud structure usually associated with indicas. The tightly-packed leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain are also streaked with muted shades of blue and purple; these hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are agitated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Finally, Blue Venom’s sky-high trichome production, passed on from White Widow, gives the already-colorful flowers a shiny white sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, this strain has the unmistakably fresh and fruity aroma of blueberries. Lurking underneath are also some hints of citrus, while breaking open or grinding up the buds releases a rich hashy, piney odor, possibly passed on from its South Asian landrace roots. Blue Venom gives off a smooth, easy smoke when burnt and leaves behind a tart blueberry taste on exhale, along with a mild herbal kick, somewhat reminiscent of Jack Herer. Notably, despite its purple hues, this strain has no discernible grape flavors. Smokers should savor Blue Venom’s unique flavor profile in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe.Blue Venom takes effect relatively quickly for an indica, initially exerting a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. Users may detect an uptick in mood along with a sudden surge in energy. This mood enhancement is typically accompanied by a sharpening of the senses; users may find that external stimuli like sights and sounds take on a new dimension. These slightly trippy effects may amplify conversations and can provide an ideal backdrop for spending time with good friends.  Rather than fueling any kind of intense cerebral thinking, this strain is more likely to help minds wander in a creative, freely-associative way. As the high wears on, Blue Venom tapers down into palpable physical relaxation. Although still mentally stimulated, smokers will find themselves content to melt into their overall surroundings. If dosage is increased, this strain can even lull users into a deep and fulfilling sleep. Because of its progression from energetic stimulation into deep sedation, Blue Venom is best enjoyed in the afternoon or early evening. Its effects can be long-lasting, even for experienced cannabis users.Blue Venom can have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its ability to relax the body can soothe aches and pains whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. It may also take temporarily blunt the harsh symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. As noted, it can work against entrenched cases of insomnia. Blue Venom can even serve as a potent appetite stimulant. Because it is unlikely to bring about intense cerebral thinking, this can be a good option for those who are prone to panic.G13 has made seeds of Blue Venom available for sale online. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although success outdoors is predicated on a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It is easily accommodated indoors, as its plants have a short and bushy indica silhouette with strong lateral branching. Those looking to bring out Blue Venom’s signature indigo hues should also expose their crops of nighttime temperatures about 10 to 15 degrees below average. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Blue Venom is an asset for kicking back and unwinding after a long day, whether you’re alone or with friends. If you do bring Blue Venom out in public, be sure to bring enough to share, as its fruity and peppery aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Blue Thai is a slightly sativa-leaning hybrid. Originally conceived in the Netherlands, it is a cross between Blueberry and pungent landrace variety Thai Skunk. Blue Thai comes to us from Dinafem, the Spanish-based breeding company responsible for other taste-focused strains in the Blueberry family like Blue Kush. Although this strain’s middling psychoactivity may not impress experience cannabis users, it can be great for newcomers. Blue Thai’s THC levels have been measured at between 13% and 21%.Blue Thai is distinguished by large-sized buds that have a tapered shape; these flowers are similar in appearance to cannabis’ close botanical relation, hops. The buds have a dense, tightly-packed structure characteristic of predominantly indica varieties. The mossy green leaves are threaded through with pale yellow pistils. Many phenotypes also show off flashes of purple ranging from lavender to deep violet. These vibrant colors come about when high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics are agitated by cool nighttime temperatures during the growing process. The colorful buds are capped off by a dusting of icy white trichomes.When properly cured, Blue Thai bursts with a pronounced blueberry aroma. Some woody, earthy base notes also lurk underneath. Grinding or breaking up the buds yields some pungent and tangy odors, evidence of the Skunk in their genetics. When combusted, Blue Thai can smell harsh and acrid and may even induce coughing. This strain’s smoke has a slightly herbal, spicy taste on the exhale. Notably, Blue Thai comes without any detectable grape flavors despite its purple leaves; this is because, while its color is determined by pigmentations, cannabis’ taste is dictated by chemical compounds called terpenes.Blue Thai has a high that mounts slowly. Several minutes after toking, users may detect a faint tingle in the face and especially in the temples. Smokers may eventually notice some alteration in their patterns of thinking, as certain thoughts or abstract concepts may seem more interesting than they ordinarily might. Nevertheless, Blue Thai allows for the kind of clear, lucid thinking that makes daily tasks like cleaning or grocery shopping more interesting. A sustained feeling of somatic relaxation pervades the high, and this meld of mental and physical effects makes Blue Thai great for activities that involve both mind and body -- including, but not limited to, exercising, dancing, or sex. Some smokers may also find that the strain inspires creativity. Blue Thai is a great wake-and-bake strain for indica fans, as it won’t incapacitate users off the bat but will still provide the relaxation needed to get through a day with minimal stress. This strain is as enjoyable out with friends as it is for solo savoring at home.Blue Thai may also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its mild euphoric uplift can take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, or anxiety. Physically relaxing effects can soothe chronic aches and pains, while anti-inflammatory properties can take care of more everyday annoyances like nausea and headaches. Because it is unlikely to lead to the kind of intense, recursive thinking associated with stronger sativas, Blue Thai is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Dinafem has made seeds of Blue Thai available for sale online. Although the strain’s Thai landrace ancestor can be difficult to grow outside of its native climate, this hybrid has been stabilized by crossbreeding and can even stand up to mold when grown outdoors. That said, successful outdoor cultivation calls for a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out Blue Thai’s eye-catching indigo hues should also expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blue Thai flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. It offers a high yield of 56 to 74 grams (or about 2 to 2.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Although it may not win over smokers with a high tolerance for THC, Blue Thai is a good option for easing newcomers into the merits of both indica and sativa strains.\n"

Created by G13 labs -- European breeders responsible for innovative strains like Royal Kush -- Blue OG also offers an interesting fruity, kushy taste. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 13% and 19%.Blue OG stands out with medium to large buds that have a pronounced cylindrical shape. The nugs are dense and compact, as might be expected of an indica-leaning strain, and the tightly-packed leaves are a pale shade of sea green. Fiery orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants -- twist their way through the curly leaves. Glassy trichomes cover these already-colorful flowers and give the buds a frosty silver appearance.A zesty orange aroma wafts up from cured buds of Blue OG. This citrus profile is accented by a slight berry tang, passed on from Blueberry. A closer inspection yields some notes of incense and hash, pointing to the strain’s Afghani and Hindu Kush lineage, while grinding up or breaking open the buds smells distinctly skunky. Blue OG burns with a harsh and acrid smoke when combusted that may induce coughing. On the exhale, it has a sharp fruity flavor matched by a slight diesel tang.Blue OG’s high creeps up slowly, often taking many minutes after smokers have finished savoring its unique flavor before making itself fully known. Smokers will eventually pick up on a sluggishness in the core and limbs and some heaviness in the eyelids, accompanied by a mounting sense of euphoria. There is some initial mental stimulation that may trigger some free-associative thinking. This cerebral mindset may be good for expansive creative brainstorming as well as for analytical problem-solving. Slowly, the body high intensifies, causing muscular tension to evaporate as deep breathing comes about more freely and easily. This combination of mental and physical effects may lend itself to activities that involve both body and mind like hiking, exercising, and even sex. Eventually, Blue OG’s indica side fully takes over, conferring full-body relaxation that deepens as the high wears on. In the later stages of the high, smokers may find themselves couchlocked. Because of its taper from productive energy into foggy relaxation, Blue OG is best suited to late afternoon use. This strain’s effects are said to be strong and long-lasting, even for cannabis veterans.Blue OG may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sedative properties can be a balm for aches and pains, whether they’re temporary as due to injury or chronic and caused by conditions like arthritis or lupus. In its early set, Blue OG may help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on any tasks at hand. Finally, this strain’s even-handed and mellow vibes can temporarily elevate to ease the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Because of its relative lack of cerebral intensity, Blue OG may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a lower tolerance for THC.Fortunately, G13 has made seeds of Blue OG available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. As plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching, growers should “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Blue OG flowers within 8 weeks when cultivated indoors and is known to offer growers a moderate yield of about 37 to 47 grams (or 1.3 to 1.7 ounces) for their efforts. Blue OG’s high is versatile enough to enjoy in various settings. It’s as enjoyable while kicking back at home as it is in more party-focused scenarios. If you do bring it out in public, bring enough to share, as this strain’s dynamic fruity aroma is likely to attract some attention. Because of its particularly high resin production, Blue OG is a very good strain for the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Blue Nightmare is a bold, pleasantly-flavored indica hybrid that’s anything but nightmarish. Created by producers RNM Flowers, it’s a cross between perennial favorite Blue Dream and Tahoe OG. If smoker’s aren’t won over by this strain’s robust berry flavor, they will be by its floaty, psychedelic body high. Blue Nightmare’s THC content has been measured at between a solid 16% and a whopping 26%.Blue Nightmare impresses with large flowers that are long and cylindrical in shape. The buds hold together in the dense, solidly-packed structure more typical of indica varieties. Leaves are a pale sage green and are set off by vibrant orange pistils. Some phenotypes of Blue Nightmare are also marked by patches of deep blue and purple; these colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Translucent white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these chunky buds, giving them a very resinous texture.When properly cured, Blue Nightmare combines the fruity and piney aromas of Blue Dream and Tahoe OG, respectively. A faint berry tang hangs on top while hints of sage and grass lurk underneath, likely passed on from grandparent strain Haze. The strain’s OG roots come through when flowers are ground up or broken open. When combusted, Blue Nightmare gives off an acrid smoke that may tickle the sinuses and induce coughing. This smoke tastes of blueberry and spice on the exhale. Consumers trying to be discreet should keep in mind that Blue Nightmare can be a particularly pungent smoke. Notably, this strain has no discernible grape flavors despite its often purple leaves -- this is because while the bud’s color is determined by pigmentation, its aroma is dictated by separate chemical compounds, called terpenes.Blue Nightmare takes effect quickly for an indica, making its presence felt before smokers have even finished coughing. The user may notice a suddenly weighty feeling in core and limbs, along with an increased capacity for deep breathing. Some mental effects are present as well in the form of sensory enhancement. This strain can have a trippy edge, with visual and even auditory distortions. Contrary to its ominous name, though, Blue Nightmare soon leads to a positive uptick in mood. This strain’s pleasant, dreamy effects can lend themselves to surges in creativity as well as giddy, free-flowing conversation. Don’t plan on focusing or achieving productivity with this hybrid, though, as it is more likely to leave you mentally foggy. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Blue Nightmare may make users melt into their overall surroundings and eventually fall asleep. As such, this strain is best enjoyed at night.Blue Nightmare may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sedation can soothe deep-seated aches and pains while its anti-inflammatory properties may alleviate headaches or indigestion. This strain’s euphoria can also temporarily numb the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. As noted, it can also counteract insomnia under the right circumstances. Because it lacks any cerebral intensity, Blue Nightmare may be a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.RNM Flowers has not made seeds of Blue Nightmare available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a warm, semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Those looking to bring out Blue Nightmare’s full indigo bag appeal should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins. Finally, just as it is a pungent smoke, Blue Nightmare may be a pungent grow and those looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Somewhat difficult to come by in commercial settings, Blue Nightmare is worth grabbing if it’s ever spotted in dispensaries. Its hazy, mellow high lends itself to a wide range of activities, from lounging in the park with friends to spending an evening unwinding at home.\n"

        "description": "Blue Jay Way is a balanced, CBD-rich hybrid with effects that lean more indica than sativa. It is the creation of Las Vegas-based producers Matrix NV, who have stabilized flavor-focused strains like Dream Queen and Tangilope. Blue Jay Way is a cross between DJ Short’s True Blueberry and old warhorse OG Kush. Specifically for a high ratio of the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD (rather than the more common and psychoactive THC), Blue Jay Way is an appealing option for those who’d like to medicate various ailments without becoming unmanageably high. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between a meager 4% to 6% while its CBD content clocks in at between 8% and 16%.Blue Jay Way is marked by impressively large, cone-shaped flowers that look almost like hops (a plant that is, in fact, closely related to cannabis). The sticky leaves adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. Leaves themselves catch the eye with vibrant shades of green and yellow and are threaded through with pale brown pistils. As with ancestral strain Blueberry, some phenotypes of Blue Jay Way also show off shades of purple in their leaves, courtesy of pigments called anthocyanins that produce these deep hues when agitated by cold weather during the growing process. These colorful flowers are also dotted with cloudy white trichomes that make them very sticky to the touch and difficult to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, Blue Jay Way shows off its deeply aromatic genetics. A sharp orange scent jumps off of the flowers, tinged with some tart berry notes. There’s also a suggestion of some old-school funk and skunkiness thanks to parent strain OG Kush. Grinding up or breaking open the buds yields some acrid, beer-like notes, further underscoring this strain’s similarity to hops. Blue Jay Way burns with a smooth, even smoke when combusted and tastes like blueberries on the exhale. A vegetal and slightly piney taste lingers on the palate for a while afterwards. Blue Jay Way acts quickly, giving smokers a faint tingle around the eyes and temples soon after they’ve toked. This physical sensation spreads down the neck and through the core, creating relaxation without necessarily feeling disorienting. While users may detect some mild changes in visual and auditory perception, full-on psychedelic distortions are not commonly reported due to the strain’s lower THC content. Instead, Blue Jay Way’s effects are characterized by soothing feelings of physical calm and mental focus that can be put to use according to the user’s preference. It can be provide a great backdrop for working through tasks as mundane as cleaning the house or as complex as analytical problem solving. In any instance, Blue Jay Way is unlikely to incapacitate those who enjoy it, instead leaving them lucid and functional -- unless, of course, dosage is increased over a short period of time, in which case the strain’s relaxation can tip over into sedation. This hybrid’s effects are said to be long-lasting for even experienced cannabis users.Because of its high CBD content, Blue Jay Way may be more useful to medical than to recreational cannabis users. Its mellow (and in some cases euphoric) vibes may alleviate the  symptoms of mild to moderate stress and anxiety. Its sustained sense of focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on any duties at hand. Physiologically, this strain may be particularly good at soothing deep-seated aches and pains, while, in high enough doses, it can work against stubborn cases of insomnia. Because of its relative lack of cerebral or psychoactive properties, Blue Jay Way may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Matrix NV has not made seeds of Blue Jay Way available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of a mature from a reputable breeder in order to grow clones. While there is little information available on best practices for cultivating this specific strain, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoor or outdoors if growers live in a warm, Mediterranean-like climate. Those looking to bring out the strain’s impressive purple hues should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Blue Jay Way’s mellow and refreshing effects are a boon to cannabis fans who’d like to self-medicate without feeling disconnected or out of control. The strain’s fruity, aromatic flavors are the icing on this CBD-filled cake.\n"

        "description": "Arthurian legend tells of a mysterious and sinister Green Knight who tests and threatens King Arthur’s court. Luckily, the strain Blue Knight is decidedly more mellow. This indica-dominant hybrid is a cross between Kryptonite and tasty staple Blueberry. A variety with serious bag appeal, Blue Knight boasts multicolored flowers and a rich complex flavor profile to match. This strain’s sedative effects are said to be very long-lasting, even for experienced cannabis users. Its THC content has been measured at between 14% and 27%.Blue Knight is distinguished by medium to large flowers that hold a solid, dense bud structure. These impressive nuggets have a distinctly conical, tapered shape. Particularly eye-catching are Blue Knight’s flowers; parent strain Kryptonite is descended from the famously colorful Mendocino Purple and it shows in Blue Knight’s deep blue and purple streaks, which exist in almost equal proportion to more conventional shades of mossy green. The former colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics -- when agitated by cold weather during the growing phase, these pigments bring about vivid colors in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn. Translucent trichomes are the crowning glory on Blue Knight’s flowers, coating the inner and outer surfaces and making them very sticky to the touch.As might be expected, Blue Knight’s buds give off an unmistakable Blueberry scent, albeit with some added sweetness. A hint of vanilla and cloves complements the fruity, tangy blueberry aroma. There are some woody, piney base notes lurking underneath, while grinding or breaking up these dense flowers yields some hashy notes. When combusted, Blue Knight gives off a smoke that is thick and lung-expanding, but smooth. On the exhale, smoke tastes fruity and slightly herbal.Blue Knight offers what might be called a creeper of a high. Several minutes after smokers have savored the strain’s unique taste, a tingle begins to emerge around the eyes and temples. This stimulation may move down the neck and through the limbs as users are able to breathe more deeply and freely. Smokers may also begin to notice changes in their perception; sights and sounds may be amplified while previously unremarkable thoughts or concepts can take on a new dimension. Rather than creating a feeling of cerebral “mind race,” though, Blue Knight tends to feel mentally subdued. Those who partake can expect to feel social and even giddy as thoughts and conversations ramble pleasantly along. As time wears on or as dosage is increased, this strain’s heavy, stoney feeling may tip into couch-lock, rendering smokers able to do little more than lounge around or fall asleep. Because of this powerful sedation, Blue Knight is best enjoyed after dark, when its almost narcotic ability to pulverize stress and tension can be fully appreciated.Blue Knight may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can be a potent analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re temporary and injury-related or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may also relieve irritations like headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, its mellow euphoria can relieve stress and anxiety. As mentioned, Blue Knight can also work against insomnia, lulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its relative lack of cerebral intensity, Blue Knight may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic.No large-scale breeders have claimed responsibility for Blue Knight’s creation or stabilization and none have made seeds available for purchase. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s signature blue and purple hues should expose their plants to cold temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Blue Knight flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.Somewhat difficult to come by, this rare strain is worth snatching up if spotted on dispensary shelves. Its well-balanced taste and stoney, all-consuming high make it as enjoyable for use at home alone as out with a group of good friends.\n"

        "description": "Blue Magic is a mostly sativa hybrid with a mysterious background. With no known breeder, this potent strain may be a distinct phenotype of the uber-popular Blue Dream, itself known to be a particularly well-balanced hybrid. Blue Magic offers a powerful cerebral kick that eventually tapers off into a more even-tempered high. With a dynamic, crowd-pleasing taste, though, this strain is sure to find loyal followers regardless of its psychoactive profile. Blue Magic’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 23%.Blue Magic is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that have a slightly tapered, pinecone-like shape. Despite the strain’s predominantly sativa effects, its buds cling together in a dense, indica-typical structure. The leaves are a vibrant shade of emerald green and are shot through with hairy pistils that range in color from pink and red to orange. Notably, Blue Magic seems not to have inherited grandparent strain Blueberry’s high concentration of anthocyanin pigments -- as a result, it’s rare to find flowers of Blue Magic that exhibit streaks of deep blue or purple. Blue Magic does have plenty of milky white trichomes, though, giving it a very resinous texture and making it difficult to break up without a quality grinder.When properly cured, Blue Magic’s overall aroma is similar to that of its forebear Blue Dream. Tropical blueberry notes predominate, creating a sweet and tangy first impression. On closer inspection, flowers also have musky, herbal hints of wood and tobacco, likely the influence of grandparent strain Haze. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields some sour odors. Blue Magic gives off a smooth and palatable smoke that tastes fruity and spicy on the exhale and leaves behind a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.Blue Magic’s high takes hold quickly, arresting smokers with its bracing mental energy. Shortly after toking, users may feel a concerted pressure behind the eyelids, accompanied by an amplification of the senses. Certain sounds or sights may seem more dynamic and deserving of attention; visual distortions are also commonly reported, giving the initial high a slightly trippy edge. As users adjust to this altered perception, they’re more able to harness the strain’s thoughtful energy toward productivity. Blue Magic allows users to maintain focus on tasks ranging from tackling unanswered emails to cleaning a long-neglected bathroom. As these sativa properties trigger frequent thought associations, the high may veer into overactive “mind race” territory for some. That said, Blue Magic is not entirely without physical relaxation to provide a counterbalance to these mental effects. As the high wears on, the early sativa power decrescendos into a lull of bodily calm. Although full-on couch-lock is uncommon, many users describe an increased ability to relax and unwind. Blue Magic’s energetic onset makes it a great choice for wake-and-bake or afternoon use, but not the best option for enjoying before bed, as it may leave smokers active and wired.Blue Magic’s mental stimulation may also have application for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained sense of focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. The strain may also help patients with mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more mindfully and presently. Finally, some anti-inflammatory effects can take care of minor everyday annoyances like headaches or nausea. Because its cerebral activity can translate into paranoia for some, Blue Magic is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Since no commercial growers have claimed responsibility for Blue Magic’s creation or made seeds available for sale, prospective growers must obtain clippings that can be grown as clones. Its Although there is little information available on best practices for cultivating Blue Magic specifically, we know that the closely-related Blue Dream can be grown indoors or outdoors in warm, semi-humid climates. We also know that Blue Dream grows short and bushy, requires frequent pruning, and flowers within 10 weeks when grown indoors.While Blue Magic’s sativa force makes it great for getting creative or analytical work done, its also a great way to inspire active conversation among friends. If you do bring this potent strain out in public, be sure to bring enough to share -- its dynamic scent is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Blue Power is an indica-dominant hybrid that allows for some therapeutic lounging. This well-rounded strain comes from a complicated genetic background: it is the product of Sour Double, Master Kush, The White, and Blue Moonshine. It was created by Vegas-based producers Sin City Seeds, the same group responsible for strains like Happy Nightmare. Blue Power’s rich lineage results in a stoney body high and a robust, fulfilling flavor profile. Blue Power’s THC content has been measured at between 18% and an impressive 27%.Note that breeders Vision Seeds have also created a strain labeled Blue Power, created as a cross between Blueberry, White Widow, and Skunk #1.Sin City’s Blue Power makes its bag appeal known right away. The medium-sized flowers show off distinctively tapered, spade-like shapes. Despite a psychoactive profile that leans more indica, these buds appear characteristically sativa, with fluffy, piecey leaves that can be easily torn away from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are shot through with fiery orange pistils. Some phenotypes of Blue Power also exhibit shades of deep blue and purple -- these hues come about when high concentration of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are excited by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Finally, notoriously sticky parent strain The White passes on its penchant for trichome production: Blue Power’s flowers are coated with cloudy white resin.Blue Power has an aroma that stands up to its visual appeal. The cured buds reek of sharp lemon and berry, along with some woodsy hints of pine. On closer inspection, there are also some astringent chemical notes, possibly passed on from Sour Double. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open these flowers yields an earthy, hashy bouquet. When combusted, Blue Power burns with a smooth and easy smoke that tastes like pine and lemon with an ammonia tang; the overall impression is that of a scented cleaning product. Those looking to keep their smoking discreet should bear in mind that Blue Power can be particularly pungent. Finally, any grape flavors associated with this strain can be considered a coincidence to its purple coloring -- while Blue Power’s appearance is determined by pigmentation, its aroma is dictated by compounds called terpenes.Blue Power’s high is something of a creeper and can take several minutes after ingestion before its effects can be fully detected. Smokers will know it’s working as a tingly body high sets in, working its way from the temples down thru the neck and core. As they feel themselves relax, users may seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. Nevertheless, Blue Power is not without some mental stimulation. This strain can exert a sustained feeling of focus that may put its fans in a creative mindset. Alternatively, it can provide the perfect backdrop for enjoying an engaging movie or a trippy album. As time wears on, Blue Power comes with an increasing likelihood of couch-lock -- and in the right set and setting, sleep. As such, this knockout of a strain is best enjoyed in the late afternoon or early evening.Medical cannabis patients may also benefit from Blue Power’s thorough, almost narcotic physical relaxation. The strain can alleviate both temporary and chronic pain; its anti-inflammatory effects may also relieve annoyances like headaches and nausea. As noted, those suffering from insomnia can find a deep, restful sleep if they consume Blue Power in high enough doses. Because it doesn’t come with the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, Blue Power may be a good choice for those who suffer from panic or anxiety.Sin City has made seeds of Blue Power available for sale online; consumers may also find seeds in several brick-and-mortar locations throughout Southern California and some of Western Europe. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Blue Power flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers only a low to moderate yield of about 23 to 37 grams (.8 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Better suited to powering down than powering up, Blue Power is a gift to indica lovers. Its unique flavor profile also makes it a great choice for enjoying in social gatherings.\n"

Although its creators remain a mystery, it is a cross between LSD and flavor-engineered Rocky Mountain Blueberry. This strain offers a strong physical sedation that appeals to indica fans, but with an added sativa spark. It has all the psychedelic potency of its parent strains, along with a complex spicy berry flavor profile. Blue Sky has a THC content that’s been measured at between 13% and 19%.Blue Sky sets itself apart with medium to large-sized buds that hold a tapered, spade-like shape -- no surprise, considering that distinctive parent strain LSD is known for oddly triangular-shaped flowers. The strain’s leaves hold together in the dense and hard bud structure typical of predominantly indica varieties. Leaves themselves are a mossy green and are shot through with vibrant red pistils. Many phenotypes of Blue Sky also actually have patches of blue in their leaves; these dynamic hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics. When excited colder than average temperatures, these pigments trigger shades of blue and purple in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to falling chlorophyll levels. These already-colorful flowers are also dotted with translucent silvery trichomes, giving them a very sticky texture.When properly cured, flowers of Blue Sky burst with a sweet blueberry tang passed on from Rocky Mountain Blueberry. On closer inspection, there are also some herbal and piney notes that keep the berry scent from seeming overly sweet. Breaking up or grinding the flowers yields some musky and earthy hints. When combusted, Blue Sky burns with a smooth smoke that tastes fruity and slightly floral on the exhale. Those expecting these violet flowers to taste like grape may be disappointed, though -- the terpene compounds that dictate the bud’s flavor have no correspondence with the pigments that determine its color.Blue Sky works quickly for an indica, beginning as a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples. This sensation is accompanied by a sudden enhancement of the senses, with sights, sounds, and even tastes taking on interesting new dimensions (and in fact, smokers may be particularly drawn to experimenting with different taste combinations, as this strain can be a powerful appetite stimulant). While Blue Sky also exerts some mental effects, these are more on the order of free-associative thinking than of intense cerebral analysis. This hazy mindset makes this a great strain for watching a trippy movie or participating in a rambling and giddy conversation with some good friends. Ultimately, Blue Sky leaves its users relaxed if not entirely incapacitated, making it great for some active socializing or unwinding. Enjoy this bud during the afternoon or early evening -- just don’t plan on harnessing any kind of productivity after you toke.Blue Sky may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its capacity to bring about somatic relaxation can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re chronic and deep-seated or only temporary. Some anti-inflammatory effects can also take care of irritations like headaches and nausea. Blue Sky’s overall mellow vibes can even temporarily relieve the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Because it is unlikely to bring about paranoid, recursive thinking, this strain may be a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No commercial breeders have taken responsibility for Blue Sky’s creation or stabilization. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from reputable breeders in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available about specific best practices for Blue Sky’s cultivation, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a warm, semi-humid climate. Those looking to bring out the strain’s signature blue hues should also expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Take a cue from this strain’s name and enjoy it while having a picnic or taking a high under a cloudless blue sky. If that’s not quite your speed, Blue Sky is just as enjoyable while hanging at home and unwinding after a long day of work.\n"

        "description": "9 Pound Hammer is a heavy-hitting indica with a patchwork genetic background. It is a three-way cross between Jack the Ripper, Hell's Angel OG and fruity Gooberry. This relaxing bud was created by prolific breeders TGA Subcool Seeds, the same producers responsible for Deep Purple and Jesus OG. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured 9 Pound Hammer's potency at between 14% and 23% THC.9 Pound Hammer is visually impressive, with large, chunky, multi-colored flowers. The buds adhere in a dense, solid formation, with short leaves coiled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with yellow and orange pistils. Flowers also commonly have flashes of purple due to high concentrations of anthocyanin pigments in their leaves; the shades of purple emerge when these pigments are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. A blanket of frosty trichomes covers the buds and makes them particularly sticky.When properly cured, 9 Pound Hammer has a strong fruity aroma with a tropical inflection. Like parent strain Jack the Ripper, it is redolent of citrus and grape. Meanwhile, breaking the buds apart gives off a strong incense-like odor courtesy of this strain's Afghani landrace lineage. When combusted in a bowl or a joint, 9 Pound Hammer burns with a remarkably smooth smoke that tastes woodsy and piney with a hint of lime on the exhale. Notably, this strain's pronounced grape flavor is entirely incidental to its purple hues -- as with any other variety, its flavor is determined by terpene compounds while its appearance is dictated by its unique pigmentation.This strain is named 9 Pound Hammer for a reason: almost immediately, it hits users over the head with its heavy-duty sedation. Deep breathing may come more easily and muscular tension may dissipate. This sensation soon progresses into a full-body high that may leave smokers feeling floaty and disoriented. In addition to these somatic effects, 9 Pound Hammer imparts some subtle mental stimulation -- while it may not trigger intense, cerebral thinking, it can alter perception, making sounds or colors take on a new intensity. If dosage is increased, this strain is liable to cause couch-lock, sapping energy and motivation along with any lingering pain and stress. As a result, 9 Pound Hammer is best enjoyed at night, when its strong sedative effects can easily transition into sleep.9 Pound Hammer can be of great value to medical cannabis patients as well. It can provide temporary relief from the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Its sedative, almost narcotic properties can relieve aches and pains of all kinds. Meanwhile, its ability to provoke hunger can help those who have lost their appetites due to medications or treatments like chemotherapy. As noted, 9 Pound Hammer is of particular interest to people who summer from insomnia; it can lull smokers into a deep and refreshing sleep. Because it rarely brings about the kind of recursive thinking that leads to paranoia, this strain is a good option for people who suffer from frequent panic or anxiety.Fortunately for growers, TGA has made seeds of 9 Pound Hammer available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It is easily accommodated indoors, where its plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers should be sure to trim away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches. Thanks to some very stable genes, it is also resistant to mildew. Finally, growers looking to bring out this strain's full bag appeal should bring out its shades of purple by exposing the plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures. 9 Pound Hammer flowers within a brief 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield of flowers for their efforts.Not a strain to be underestimated, 9 Pound Hammer is an ideal choice for weekend or evening relaxation. Although its mellow vibes can be very social, it may be better suited to use with good friends rather than new acquaintances because of its tendency to inhibit conversation.\n"

        "description": "Huckleberry is a well-balanced hybrid with a mysterious backstory. Its parent strains -- as well its creator -- are unknown, although the strain’s strong berry scent and taste suggest a Blueberry lineage. Whatever its origin, Huckleberry offers a crowd-pleasing aroma and a multi-faceted high that’s as enjoyable while out on an adventure as it is when you’re lounging on your couch. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 8% and a staggering 26%.Buds of Huckleberry are small to medium in size and spherical in shape, clinging together in popcorn-like clusters. These flowers have the thick and tightly-packed bud structure often associated with indica-dominant varieties. Leaves are a mossy shade of green and are threaded through with orange to red pistils. Phenotypes of the strain frequently display patches of purple in their leaves, in almost equal proportion to green; these surprising shades are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics. Finally, translucent white trichomes coat the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers, giving them a silvery sheen.The smell of sweet and tart berries wafts up from cured buds of Huckleberry, lending credence to the theory that this strain is descended from Blueberry. The fruity aroma is devoid of any funky or kush-like scents; there are also no pronounced skunky odors. That said, grinding up or breaking open these dense buds yields some slightly spicy notes, possibly suggesting an Afghani landrace in Huckleberry’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, these flowers burn with a smoke that is almost universally described as harsh and cough-inducing. This smoke tastes fruity and cloyingly sweet on the exhale. Notably, despite its purple coloring, Huckleberry has no detectable grape flavors -- this is because, while the strain’s color is determined by its pigmentation, its bouquet is dictated by separate chemical compounds called terpenes.Huckleberry’s high takes effect quickly, smacking users with a sudden uptick in higher-order processing. This stimulation of cerebral and analytical thinking is met with a strong jolt of energy. As a result, Huckleberry is an ideal strain for getting work done, whether it’s problem-oriented or more loosely-defined and creative. Alternatively, it can provide the motivation needed to accomplish mundane tasks like cleaning. As the high progresses, a mildly disorienting sense of physical relaxation begins to emerge. Smokers may feel a heaviness in the limbs (and eyelids) and a sudden desire to lounge in the closest comfortable surroundings. This combination of mental and physical effects translates into a palpable feeling of euphoria. In its later, more dreamy stages, Huckleberry’s high lends itself to trippy surroundings like atmospheric music or movies. Because of the indica sedation that creeps through on its backend, this strain is recommended for use during the day or the early afternoon.Huckleberry’s versatile effects can be useful to medical cannabis patients as well. Its sustained feeling of clarity and focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on a single task. Its mood-altering effects can also give patients struggling with stress or depression to gain a fresh perspective and to spend their time more mindfully and consciously. Physiologically speaking, this strain may provide moderate relief from deep-seated aches and pains. In high enough doses, it can work against stubborn instances of insomnia. Because its onset may lead to some intense, recursive thinking, Huckleberry should be consumed with caution by users who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No large commercial producers have made seeds of Huckleberry available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain may be a temperamental grow, and is not recommended for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out Huckleberry’s full purple bag appeal should stimulate its anthocyanins by exposing their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Huckleberry flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Huckleberry’s mellow, even-handed high is welcome in a wide variety of settings. It can be savored alone or shared with friends. If you do bring this fruity bud out in public, be prepared for its pleasant aroma to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Cookie Monster is an indica-dominant strain that blends the rock-solid lineage of two famous strains. Not to be confused with the genetically similar Monster Cookies, Cookie Monster is a cross between the uber-popular Girl Scout Cookies and OG Kush. This strain delivers long-lasting and therapeutic relaxation; it has a potency that earned it the title of Best Indica in Seattle’s 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup. Cookie Monster’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 23%.Although only small to medium in size, flowers of Cookie Monster impress consumers with a vivid array of colors. The spring green leaves cling together in a dense, indica-typical bud structure and are shot through with vibrant orange pistis. More often than not, phenotypes of this strain boast streaks of dark blue and purple in their leaves -- these colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these spherical buds, giving them a sticky texture and accounting for their high psychoactivity.Cookie Monster’s flowers have a predominantly earthy aroma when properly cured, marked by notes of hashy sandalwood along with a faint, cheesy tang. Closer inspection reveals a biscuity odor that may be familiar to fans of parent strain Girl Scout Cookies. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking the cured nugs yields some herbal scents, with hints of mint and pine. When combusted, Cookie Monster may burn with a harsh and acrid smoke that can tickle the back of the palate and cause eyes to water. This thick smoke tastes floral and slightly dank on the exhale. Cookie Monster can be a particularly pungent smoke, and those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take precautions before toking in public.Cookie Monster offers what can be described as a creeper of a high. Initial effects may begin to emerge after about fifteen minutes, at which point users detect a pressure around the eyes and temples. This sensation is accompanied by some subtle mental stimulation -- although the effects are more calming than energetic. Smokers may experience some sensory distortion as well as a strong sense of time dilation. This trippy, euphoric mindset can be a great way to explore creative visualization; it may also enhance low-energy activities like grocery shopping or doing the dishes. Otherwise, this high is mostly characterized by a weighty physical relaxation: users may detect a dissipation of lingering muscular tension, along with an increased capacity for deep breathing. As time passes or as dosage is increased, users may experience an intractable feeling of couch-lock (albeit while still maintaining a clear mind). More appropriate for nighttime than daytime use, Cookie Monster can also work against stubborn instances of insomnia.This strain’s sedative effects can have wide-ranging application for medical cannabis patients as well. It can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary as due to injury or chronic as due to serious conditions like fibromyalgia. Cookie Monster’s anti-inflammatory effects may also provide relief from more common annoyances like nausea and headaches. Finally, this strain can temporarily soothe the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Because its mental stimulation is unlikely to tip over into paranoia, Cookie Monster is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No commercial-grade producers have made seeds of Cookie Monster available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of this strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This variety can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers looking to accentuate Cookie Monster’s blue and purple highlights should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees lower than average. Just as this strain can be a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow; growers looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.A welcome addition to the Cookie family, Cookie Monster is sure to please indica fans. Although its flavor profile may prove divisive, its smooth and tranquil high is sure to be a crowd-pleaser when this bud is shared in social situations.\n"

        "description": "Although chronic is a popular catch-all term for cannabis -- appearing in everything from Dr. Dre albums to contemporary fiction -- Chronic is also the name of a particular strain. Chronic is a cross between three powerhouse varieties: AK-47, Northern Lights, and Skunk #1. It comes to us from Serious Seeds, the Canadian producers responsible for strains like White Russian and Double Dutch. Chronic delivers a well-rounded high that’s right at home in a variety of situations. Its THC content has been measured at between 10% and 20%; the strain also includes the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD, with levels ranging from 1% to 13%.Chronic is marked by small to medium flowers that cling together in clustered, popcorn-like formations. The buds hold a dense, indica-typical structure with tightly-coiled leaves. The leaves themselves are a musty shade of olive green, offset by vibrant red pistils. A coat of translucent amber trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of Chronic’s flowers, lending them a dewy, yellowish tint.When properly cured, Chronic explodes with a strong, skunky odor. Sweet and earthy base notes provide a contrast to this powerful funk; on closer inspection, there are also some woodsy hints of pine. Breaking open or grinding up Chronic’s buds yields a hashy, spicy scent, perhaps evidence of the Afghani landrace in parent strain AK-47’s roots. When combusted, this strain burns with an acrid smoke that many describe as harsh and cough-inducing. The smoke tastes slightly fruity and peppery on the exhale and may linger on the palate for a while afterward. Those looking to keep their cannabis consumption discreet should take some precautions, as Chronic can be a very pungent smoke.Chronic’s high takes effect quickly, rocketing smokers into an intense headspace marked by fast-paced, freely associative thinking. This mindset is good for creative brainstorming and for analytically working through problem-oriented scenarios. In its early stages, Chronic can also be a good complement to mundane activities like cleaning or running errands. In social settings, the strain’s upbeat vibes can translate into giddy conversation and shared laughter. As time passes, this hybrid’s body high emerges, in part due to its CBD content. The growing sense of physical relaxation is good for unwinding with friends after a long day or, alternatively, taking yourself on a solo date to the movies. Although Chronic’s sedation can put smokers’ bodies out of commission in high enough doses, it tends to leave their minds relatively clear. A great remedy for insomnia, Chronic is best enjoyed during the evening or right before bed. The high is said to be long lasting -- in some cases persisting for up to six hours -- even for veteran cannabis consumers.Chronic’s levels of CBD shine through to confer benefits for medical cannabis patients. The strain can temporarily numb deep-seated aches and pains, both temporary and long-term. CBD also comes in handy to confer med benefit. It may also provoke hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to severe treatments like chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, Chronic can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration. Because the mind race associated with this strain’s onset can often lead to paranoia, it is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Several producers have made seeds of Chronic available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because it boasts a favorable flower to leaf ratio, Chronic does not require regular “topping” or pruning in order to maximize yield. This strain flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Just as it can be a pungent smoke, Chronic can also be a very pungent grow: cultivators who want to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.A potent and full-bodied hybrid, Chronic makes a great all-purpose strain for the seasoned smoker. Its name (which is something of a throwback) can also be a fun way to embrace 90s nostalgia.\n"

        "description": "Rafael (sometimes spelled Refael or Raphael) is a sativa-dominant hybrid that is rich in the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD. This potent bud’s name is not a reference to the Renaissance painter or the Ninja Turtle -- instead, it’s taken from a Hebrew term meaning “God is healer.” Rafael was developed by prolific Israeli company Tikun Olam (whose name, incidentally, is a religious and philosophical phrase meaning “heal the world”). While its genetics are unknown, Rafael is known to offer relaxing and pain killing effects. Its THC has been measured at between 1% and 2% while its CBD content ranges from 15% to 17%.Rafael is marked by medium to large flower that adhere in irregular shapes. The chunky buds have long leaves that spiral outward in a sativa-like manner, appearing loose and fluffy. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of bluish-green. These flowers are also twisted through with brown and orange pistils and, due to being selectively bred for low THC content, have few or no trichomes.When properly cured, flowers of Rafael give off a fruity, sweet aroma. On closer inspection, there are also some earthy, hashy notes. Meanwhile, grinding these large nuggets releases a family herbal odor. When combusted, Rafael burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke that tastes like peaches and herbs on the exhale.Typically strains that are in higher in CBD than THC have little to no psychoactive recreational effects. Not so with Rafael, whose sense of relaxation is so pervasive as to have an almost hypnotic influence on the user. Rafael’s high can be a creeper, taking several minutes to reveal itself after consumers have toked on its pleasant smoke. When the high does arrive, it tends to exert a strong numbing property on the limbs and core, leading any active smokers to take a load off on the closest comfortable couch. The spacey feelings that ensue may be enjoyable or disorienting, depending on the individual user’s mindset and surroundings. If this mood is welcome, though, it can be amplified through atmospheric enhancements like calming music or a trippy movie. Unlikely to bring about any intense or freely-associative patterns of thought, Rafale is a nice, subtle way to take the edge off of a long day or week of work. The strain can also loosen inhibitions in social situations, facilitating easy conversation and camaraderie when shared with like-minded friends or acquaintances.Rafael’s applications for medical cannabis patients flow from its high levels of CBD. It can be a very effective analgesic for physical pain, whether that pain is temporary or deep-seated and chronic. The bud’s anti-inflammatory properties are good for a range of ailments, from headaches to fevers. Psychological benefits include possible temporary relief from the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. In the right set and setting, Rafael may even lull susceptible smokers to sleep. Because of its mostly physical effects, Rafael is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Tikun Olam has not made seeds of Rafael available for sale online. It may also be difficult for home growers to obtain authentic clippings of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” If you are lucky enough to have the means of cultivating this exclusive strain, note that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate.Rafael (whose name may be a dual reference to Israeli scientist Ralph Mechoulam who first identified THC in 1964) is a powerful asset to recreation and medical consumers alike.\n"

        "description": "A potent member of the OG family, Bubba OG is a must-try for hybrid fans. This strain was developed by Canadian producers Dr. Greenthumb Seeds as a cross between the famed Pre-98 cut of Bubba Kush and Ghost OG, another OG Kush descendant. It’s a knockout-grade indica, sure to pull the plug on stress and pain while allowing smokers to maintain a clear head. Bubba OG has consistently high THC levels and has been tested at between 15% and 27%.Bubba OG has small to medium-sized flowers that have a clustered, chunky appearance. The buds adhere in a dense formation, typical of indica varieties. Leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with red to orange pistils. In many cases, flowers of Bubba OG are a patchwork of green, purple, and blue. These latter colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by cold weather during vegetation; the process is not dissimilar from the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted levels of chlorophyll. The already-colorful flowers are capped off by a coating of translucent white trichomes.When properly cured, flower of Bubba OG carry the sweet aroma of berries and citrus. On closer inspection, there are also base notes of hash and incense, likely the influence of double grandparent strain OG Kush. Meanwhile, breaking open or grinding up the flowers yields hints of fresh pine. When combusted, Bubba OG burns with a thick, harsh smoke that may tickle the back of the palate and trigger coughing for some. On the exhale, this smoke can taste sweet like overly ripe fruit, along with some subtle diesel fumes.Bubba OG hits quickly for an indica-dominant strain. Shortly after they’ve finished coughing, smokers feel a sensation of warmth and comfort enveloping the core and limbs. This weighty feeling may lead them to lounge in the closest cushy surroundings. The strain’s pleasant physical effects are soon met with a wave of euphoria and a subsequent desire to share the good vibes with familiar friends. Bubba OG may make external stimuli seem more significant to the smoker; color can seem more saturated, and even taste can take on new dimensions. This type of trippy distortion is the perfect backdrop for processing some atmospheric music or television. Despite its mostly sleep vibes, though, Bubba OG still allow users to maintain a clear head. If they so desire, smokers can remain focused on any tasks that don’t involve physical activity or coordination. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, intractable couch-lock may set in, followed closely by full, sleep-inducing sedation. Because it can be so soporific, Bubba OG is recommended for evening or nighttime use. Some negative side effects of the high include red eyes and a feeling of cottonmouth.Bubba OG’s thorough sedation can have many benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its physical numbing can ease aches and pains, whether they’re temporary as due to injury or chronic as caused by conditions like lupus or arthritis. Its mood-altering effects may also provide temporary refuge from the acute symptoms of stress and depression. Finally, Bubba OG can ameliorate the painful intraocular pressure that is a primary symptom of glaucoma. Because it comes with a low risk of paranoid, cerebral thought patterns, this strain can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, Dr. Greenthumb has made seeds of Bubba OG available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. That said, this hardy strain may be resistant to adverse conditions like frost. Those looking to bring out Bubba OG’s colorful purple potential should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. It offers a somewhat low yield of about 33 to 42 grams (1 to 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.As OG Kush continues to spawn distinct phenotypes and new crossbreeds, Bubba OG is sure to hold a place as one of the most esteemed. This powerful hybrid is a gift to cannabis novices and veterans alike.\n"

        "description": "Berry Bomb is a balanced hybrid with indica leanings and a bag appeal that consistently blows users away. Developed by Bomb Seeds, a Netherlands-based producer, this flavor-focused strain delivers mental stimulation and a strong body high that’s great for mellow unwinding. Berry Bomb is a cross between fruity staple Blueberry and Bomb Seeds’ own flagship strain Bomb #1. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between a modest 10% and a solid 23%.Berry Bomb is marked by small to medium-sized buds that cling together in dense, pebbly clusters. Broad at their bases, the flowers taper down into a spade-like shape. The tightly-curled leaves are a mossy shade of green and are threaded through with orange to rust-colored pistils. Many phenotypes of Berry Bomb also show off muted shades of blue and purple in their leaves; these surprising hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. A dusting of translucent white trichomes gives the colorful buds a dewy appearance and a sticky texture.The influence of parent strain Blueberry on Berry Bomb’s aroma is clear, as the unmistakable scent of blueberries wafts up from the cured buds. There are also some woodsy notes of cedar and pine that ground out this fruity character and keep it from smelling overly sweet. Breaking open the flowers may yield some peppery odors as well. When combusted, Berry Bomb gives off a smoke that is smooth but thick and lung-expanding. This smoke carries a sweet and tart blueberry tang when exhaled. Notably, this strain’s blueberry flavor and aroma are entirely incidental to the blue coloring of its leaves -- this is because, while the plant’s hues are determined by pigmentations, its flavor profile is dictated by separate chemical compounds called terpenes.Berry Bomb is often described as a creeper of a high, sometimes taking up to fifteen minutes before its effects can be detected. Smokers describe an initial tingle around the eyes and temples, along with an increased feeling of well-being. A sense of amplified sensory perception is common, and many describe slight visual distortions. Thought-provoking without being overly cerebral, these mental effects can be a great way to lounge indoors and watch movies on a rainy day. As the high wears on, Berry Bomb’s trippy head high gives way to a palpable body stone, weighing down both eyelids and limbs. Any lingering muscular tension is pulverized as the stresses and irritations of the day melt away. Smokers may find themselves rushing for the closest comfortable surroundings to take full advantage of this strain’s thorough relaxation. Berry Bomb’s can be long-lasting, even for experienced cannabis consumers. Because of its slide into lethargy and immobilization, this bud is best enjoyed at nighttime. Drymouth is commonly reported as a negative side effect.Berry Bomb’s ability to confer lasting relaxation can also have uses for medical cannabis patients. Its calming properties may temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, anxiety, and depression. It can also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, as well as more everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. In high enough doses, this strain can pull insomniacs under into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its relative lack of cerebral intensity, Berry Bomb is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Creators Bomb Seeds sell seeds of Berry Bomb directly through their website. This strain is a good choice for newcomers to cultivation, as its hardy genetics make it resistant to mold and other adverse conditions. Berry Bomb can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Plants tend to be short and bushy, with strong lateral branching; these squat crops are easily accommodated indoors. Growers looking to accentuate Berry Bomb’s shades of blue and purple should expose the plants to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees lower than average. This strain flowers within a short 7 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors. It offers growers an excellent yield for their efforts, giving up about 46 to 55 grams (or 1.6 to 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.A good choice for either social or solo use at the end of a long day, Berry Bomb proves that it’s not necessary to sacrifice potency for a fruity novelty flavor when it comes to cannabis breeding.\n"

        "description": "Afgoo (sometimes known as Afgooey) is an indica-dominant hybrid that relies on potent landrace genetics to deliver strong, lasting sedation. As its name implies, this strain is descended from an Afghani indica landrace that has been crossed with flavorful Maui Haze. A staple strain in its own right, Afgoo has a rich and earthy flavor profile to complement its sleepy, weighty vibes. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of Afgoo to have between 14% and 28% THC composition.Afgoo is marked by small to medium buds that adhere in the dense and solid bud structure that is often associated with indica varieties. These flowers range in shape from almost spherical to elongated and cylindrical. The tightly-coiled leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are threaded through with rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). The “goo” in Afgoo’s name refers to its copious amounts of resin, which ooze out of a blanket of trichomes.Parent strain Afghani reveals itself in Afgoo’s complex aroma. When properly cured, buds of Afgoo reek of damp earth and wood. Some faintly skunky notes also lurk underneath to lend some pungency. Bringing up or grinding these sticky buds yields a hint of spice and pepper, likely passed on from the Haze in this strain’s genetics. Given its hashy bouquet, Afgoo burns with a surprisingly smooth smoke that tastes of sweet pine on the exhale.Unlike many indicas, Afgoo’s high hits quickly, conferring a warmth that begins in the face and spreads down through the neck and core. As smoker’s limbs begin to feel weighty, their anxiety dissipates and the outside world begins to recede into the background. Rather than triggering cerebral, analytical thinking, though, Afgoo puts users in a dreamy mindset that slowly blossoms into euphoria. In moderate doses, this sedative strain won’t necessarily pin users down with couch-lock, leaving them free to perform mundane tasks or errands. Because this strain is not well-suited to deep mental focus, any more complicated duties should be executed before toking. If dosage is increased, Afgoo’s high may tip over into physical immobilization and may even lull smokers into a deep, restful sleep. This strain’s high is said to be long-lasting, even for experienced cannabis consumers. Finally, because of its low-key character, Afgoo is best enjoyed during the evening or nighttime when its decline into sedation can be fully savored.This strain can have wide-ranging application for medical cannabis patients as well. Afgoo’s mood-altering effects can provide temporary relief from the troubling symptoms of stress, anxiety, and even PTSD. Physiologically speaking, its almost narcotic properties may numb pain, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Anti-inflammatory can soothe more everyday irritations like headaches or nausea. Finally, as noted, Afgoo may counteract entrenched cases of insomnia. Because it is unlikely to bring about paranoid, recursive thinking, this strain is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Until recently, this legendary strain could only be grown as a clone, from clippings taken from existing plants. Several online retailers now sell seeds of Afgoo. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or outdoors. Although it fares best in semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range, Afgoo’s hardy landrace roots make it somewhat resistant to adverse growing conditions like temperature variations. Plants grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Growers should regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can prevent light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Afgoo flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors. Growers should be sure to preserve the potency of their harvest through proper curing. This process involves first hanging up the trimmed buds to dry out for one week in conditions of 50% humidity; and then sealing the dried flowers in airtight containers in conditions of 60-65% humidity.Certainly a strain to savor as you kick back after a long day, Afgoo lives up to its reputation as a classic indica. This strain’s high resin output also makes it a great choice for the production of hash or other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Alaskan Thunderfuck is a sativa-dominant with a complicated genetic history. It is said to have originated in Alaska’s Matanuska Valley as a cross between an unnamed Northern California strain and an unnamed Russian ruderalis (a less-seen genus of cannabis distinct from either indica or sativa). The child of these two strains was then crossed with an Afghani indica landrace to yield the potent staple that we know as Alaskan Thunderfuck. This strain confers a strong sense of mental focus alongside some subtle physical relaxation. Flower of Alaskan Thunderfuck have been tested at between 13% and 27%.Alaskan Thunderfuck sets itself apart with chunky buds that are medium to large in size and have a tapered, spade-like appearance. The leaves, which are a pale shade of sea green, have a fluffy look and feel and can be easily torn away from their central stems. Vibrant orange pistils wind their way through these piecey leaves. Finally, a dense blanket of trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, making them sticky and particularly hard to break up without the help of a grinder.When properly cured, Alaskan Thunderfuck has a primarily woodsy aroma, redolent of pine and cedar. There are also base notes of damp earth, along with an indefinable nutty, chocolate-like scent. Only closer inspection, hints of lemon are present as well. When combusted, Alaskan Thunderfuck burns with a funky, acrid smoke that some may find objectionable or harsh. On the exhale, this smoke leaves behind an astringent ammonia tang accented by a lingering sour lemon taste. Smokers should keep in mind that this can be a very pungent strain when burnt; those looking to maintain discretion should take any needed precautions.The high from Alaskan Thunderfuck is something of a creeper, often waiting until users have finished coughing or wiping away their smoke-induced tears to make its effects fully known. Smokers may detect by a gradually mounting alteration of the senses, with certain sights or sounds taking on a dynamic new significance. Once users acclimate to the change, this cerebral mindset lends itself to deep analytical thinking that can be valuable for working on problem-solving scenarios or as an accompaniment to free-wheeling creative brainstorming. In a more relaxed set and setting, Alaskan Thunderfuck can be a great complement to trippy music, as well as to engaging conversation between friends. As the high wears on, some subtle physical tingling sets in, although these effects are unlikely to cause disorientation or couchlock. In its later stages, Alaskan Thunderfuck may enhance more active pursuits like hiking; it can even be a strong aphrodisiac. A consummate sativa, Alaskan Thunderfuck is a good option for the user who wants to maintain a clear head while going about their day. While it makes a great wake-and-bake strain, this is not a flower to be savored just before bed, as it’s liable to leave smokers wide-eyed and wired. A small dose of this potent hybrid can go a long way, even for more experienced cannabis users.Alaskan Thunderfuck’s wide-ranging effects can also have application for medical cannabis patients. Its long-lasting lucidity may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. Its subtle mood enhancement can benefit users with mild to moderate stress and depression, leading them to spend their time more presently and mindfully. Physiological effects include some anti-inflammatory properties that can soothe headaches or nausea. Because its cerebral onset may lead to an out-of-control feeling of “mind race,” Alaskan Thunderfuck is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Many companies have produced seeds of this famous strain and made them available for sale online. Once obtained, Alaskan Thunderfuck can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor cultivation calls for a warm, semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight. As is typical of sativas, it has a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors; grown outdoors, it is ready for harvest in mid October. Alaskan Thunderfuck offers growers a high yield in reward for their efforts. Finally, just as it can be a pungent smoke, this hybrid can be a very pungent strain to grow -- those looking to keep their cultivation operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Revered among cannabis consumers, Alaskan Thunderfuck has even lent its name to drag queen superstar Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 (who, for propriety’s sake, simply goes by Alaska). With a complex, surprising flavor profile and a lasting head high, it’s no wonder that this is one of the most popular sativas in circulation today.\n"

        "description": "With a silly name that nevertheless pays tribute to some rock solid genetics, Blurple is a potent indica-dominant hybrid. This strain is a cross between Blue Dream and Mendocino Purps -- both perennial favorites -- and it offers all the bag appeal of both parent strains. Blurple’s complex, almost gourmet aroma will impress novice and experienced users alike, while its easygoing, well-balanced high is right at home in a variety of contexts. Blurple’s THC content has been measured at between 10% and 19%.Although only small to medium in size, Blurple’s flowers stun consumers with their vivid array of colors. The densely-packed leaves are a dark green, nearly verging on brown. Hairy orange pistils wind their way through the solid, spade-shaped buds. Many phenotypes of the strain also boast streaks of dark blue and purple in their leaves, the result of pigments called anthocyanins being stimulated by cold temperatures during the growing process. Dewy, translucent trichomes finish off these impressive nugs, coating leaf surfaces and giving this strain a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Blurple emits a distinctly herbal aromatic profile, with notes of musk and fresh-cut grass. A sweet berry aroma and a touch of grape prevent this odor from seeming too dank or earthy. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the dense flowers yields a floral smell. When combusted, Blurple gives off a smoke that is smooth but nevertheless thick and lung-expanding. This smoke tastes peppery and has a slight berry tang that lingers on the exhale. Notably, any subtle grape flavors associated with this strain are entirely unrelated to its purple coloring; while a strain’s hues are determined by pigmentations, its aroma is dictated by different chemical compounds called terpenes.Blurple’s high is something of a creeper and may take several minutes after users have finished toking before revealing the full extent of its effects. Users will detect mounting alteration of the senses, culminating in a full-on fascination with otherwise mundane external stimuli. Sights and sounds may more dynamic, making this strain a good accompaniment to trippy movies or music. As the high wears on, a sense of physical relaxation creeps in, relieving tension and allowing deep breathing to happen more freely and easily. While not necessarily couch-locked, users may be less inclined to pursue overly physical activities. Blurple eventually averages out into a mellow mindset that can lend itself to some casual socializing and free-flowing conversation. Smokers stride a balance between mental stimulation and contented relaxation. This strain is best enjoyed during the daytime or early evening when users can take full advantage of its early focus and productivity.Blurple may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its physical sedation can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic and disease-related. Blurple may also stoke hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to medication. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may ease irritations like headaches or nausea. Finally, Blurple’s tendency to elevate mood can provide temporary relief from the symptoms of stress and depression. Because it doesn’t often bring about intense, cerebral thinking, this strain is a good option for those who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial-scale breeders have assumed responsibility for Blurple’s creation and none have made seeds of the strain available for sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Blurple can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out this strain’s titular hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees lower than average. Growers should also be sure to preserve this strain’s unique flavor by properly curing their harvest. Curing first requires freshly-trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for a week and then sealed in airtight containers and stored in conditions of 60-65% humidity; as they cure, buds should regularly be checked for mold or mildew.Great for social or solo use, Blurple’s versatility makes it a great staple for any all-purpose cannabis user. When broken out in public, its crowd-pleasing taste and middle-of-the-road effects are sure to win over some new friends or at least attract a few new acquaintances.\n"

        "description": "Although its name is often a reference to dealers of hard and dangerous drugs, in this case, Dr. Feelgood is a potent well-balanced hybrid that’s anything but dangerous. Creators Colorado Seed Company crossed their own Gupta Kush -- named for cannabis advocate Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- with Harlequin, a strain rich in CBD, THC’s non-psychoactive counterpart. As a result, this hybrid offers physical effects that can be as therapeutic as they are entertaining. The strain also offers a musky, earthy flavor profile that will appeal to fans of OG varieties. Dr. Feelgood’s THC levels range from 16% to 20% while its CBD levels run from 1% to 10%.Dr. Feelgood is marked by medium to large-sized buds that adhere in a dense, solid bud structure. The flowers typically have an elongated shape that almost appears cylindrical. The leaves, which curl tightly inward toward their central stems, are a mossy green and are threaded through with twisting orange pistils. Many phenotypes of the strain are also flecked with pale shades of purple; these eye-catching hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics (possibly passed on from multicolored parent strain Harlequin) being stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. A thick coat of translucent white trichomes dots the inner and outer surfaces and give the flowers a silvery sheen.The dank aroma of wet soil wafts up from cured buds of Dr. Feelgood. Some woodsy notes of pine and cedar accent this aroma and stop it from seeming overly musky. Grinding up or breaking open the flowers also yields some hashy and incense-like odors due to the influence of OG Kush. When combusted, Dr. Feelgood burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that can make eyes water and trigger coughing. On the exhale, the smoke leaves a musky, leathery aftertaste. Notably, Dr. Feelgood has no discernible grape flavors despite its often purple buds. This is because color and aroma are determined by pigments and terpenes, respectively -- which are separate chemical compounds.Dr. Feelgood offers a gradual, creeping high. Several minutes after toking, consumers will begin to feel a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples. Some sights and sounds may take on a new dynamic as well, with many even reporting visual distortions. These trippy effects inspire creativity in some, making this a great strain to enjoy during some introspective solo time. In more social settings, Dr. Feelgood can inspire engaging and free-flowing conversation. As time passes, this strain’s CBD content makes itself known. Users will feel a stoney body melt from the eyelids down to the toes. Couch-lock is not unheard of, and anyone looking to sustain productivity should opt for a more sativa-leaning strain. In high enough doses, Dr. Feelgood will lull smokers into a deep and restful sleep. This strain is not recommended for use during the day because of its tendency to bring about lethargy and apathy.Because of the CBD in its genes, Dr. Feelgood can offer effective relief from physical symptoms. It soothes aches and pains, whether they’re temporary as due to injury or chronic as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Its anti-inflammatory properties can take care of everyday annoyances like headaches or nausea. As noted, this strain’s sedative effects may work against even stubborn cases of insomnia. Because it is unlikely to bring about recursive cerebral thinking, Dr. Feelgood may be good for users who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Dr. Feelgood’s creators Colorado Seed Company have not made seeds of the strain available for sale online. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” A forgiving strain for newcomers to cultivation, Dr. Feelgood thrives indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Those looking to bring out the strain’s eye-catching purple hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 to 15 degrees lower than average. Dr. Feelgood flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Dr. Feelgood’s thoroughly relaxing effects are a great way to unwind after a long day, whether you’re lounging alone at home or spending time with some close friends.\n"

        "description": "Have you ever dreamed of sipping your morning coffee on the balcony of a tropical beachside villa? Well, this strain won’t quite bring you that same experience, but it sure tastes like it. This fruity sativa-dominant hybrid crosses Golden Pineapple with Golden Nugget for a luminescent high you won’t soon want to break from. Though the breeders of this Girl Scout Cookie derivative are unknown, we thank them all the same for bringing us this gem. The THC levels of Golden Panda vary dramatically, with anything between 15% and 30% being considered normal. These fluffy little nugs offer a showcase of lime and minty green leaves with frosty white trichomes and a tropical flavor that lingers in the air. Enjoy the pineapple and coffee notes on your nose and the sweet fruity and mocha flavors from first inhale to last. Anyone who has a discerning palate will surely love what Golden Panda can provide.Like the sun dancing on your skin, this high is light and tingly, reminiscent of a relaxing day at the beach. From the first puff, your mind will be completely and blissfully at ease, followed by total relaxation that washes over your body.  The cerebral rush gives way to a longer lasting creative and focused head high that’s great if you have work to do. If you have someone to enjoy this buzz with, many have used this particular strain as an aphrodisiac. Users love this strain as a treatment for a multitude of ailments, including insomnia, lack of appetite, and aches and pain. However, its most common and probably most recommended use is for the instant and long-lasting relief of anxiety. Those who suffer from PTSD, depression, and stress disorders love this strain because of its utterly relaxing and joyful properties. Mood stimulators are helpful in staving off the edge that many suffering from mental illness often report feeling. Although many would like to try Golden Panda in their own private garden, there is unfortunately very little information on prime growing conditions, helpful tips, and the like. With breeders remaining quiet and offering little in the way of instruction, this plant remains a tantalizing mystery.  The nuttiness of this smoke and her refreshing pineapple finish make this bud a tasty and heady high that’s great for day or night use. For a smooth buzz that brings you to the ultimate happy place, Golden Panda is a great companion to turn to. \n"

        "description": "Abusive OG is a distinct phenotype of famed strain OG Kush. Having originated in California, this is a mostly indica cut that proffers deep physical relaxation alongside a rich and earthy flavor profile. Despite its name, you’re more likely to receive healing and relaxation than abuse from this potent strain -- cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has consistently found buds of Abusive OG to have between 14% and a whopping 32% THC content.Abusive OG stands out with large to medium-sized buds that cling together in a dense, indica-typical structure. These nuggets are almost spherical, with small leaves curling inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with bright orange and red hairs (which are actually pistils, reproductive structures intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Occasionally, Abusive OG exhibits faint shades of blue and lavender in its leaves; these hues come about when colder than average weather stimulates pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics. Finally, a coating of icy white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, accounting for Abusive OG’s psychoactivity and making it very sticky to the touch.When properly cured, flowers of Abusive OG give off a powerfully dank and hashy aroma; OG Kush appears to have passed on its famous incense-like character, without some of the skunky or fermented scents typically associated with the strain. Some tangy lemon notes lurk underneath, brightening up the overall impression. Meanwhile, breaking open or grinding up the buds yields a robust pine scent. When combusted, Abusive OG burns with a smoke that can be harsh and acrid and may trigger coughing or watery eyes. On the exhale, this strong smoke leaves behind a piney lemon taste reminiscent of artificially scented cleaning products. This can be a very pungent flower and smokers looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.Abusive OG’s high is something of a creeper and may take up to fifteen minutes after smokers have finished coughing and savoring the strain’s flavor before fully revealing its effects. Initial effects may be detected as a tingling around the eyes and especially in the extremities. Although these sensations may be somewhat disorienting, once users are able to adjust, they find themselves struck by heavy mental and physical sedation. Stressors evaporate as muscles fully relax and as breathing happens more deeply and easily. This strain grants some mental stimulation, although smokers are more likely to feel dreamy and hazy than intensely cerebral. This free-flowing mindset can lend itself to creative brainstorming and to engaging conversation with close friends. As the high progresses, couch-lock and an intractable feeling of body melt are common. In high enough doses, Abusive OG will even lull users into a deep, restful sleep. As might be expected, Abusive OG is better suited to nighttime than to morning or afternoon use.Medical cannabis patients may also benefit from Abusive OG’s thoroughgoing sedation. It can numb deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. Anti-inflammatory properties can relieve everyday irritations like fibromyalgia or lupus. The strain can also be a powerful appetite stimulant, stoking hunger for those who have lost their appetites to disease or to some severe side effects of medication. Although it does not typically bring about paranoia, those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume this strain in moderation, as its feeling of physical heaviness can be disorienting for the uninitiated.Although seeds of Abusive OG are available for sale online, consumer should also investigate the reputation and credentials of any digital seed retailers. Alternatively, growers can obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out the strain’s subtle hues of blue and purple should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures. Just as Abusive OG can be a pungent smoke, it is also a pungent grow and those looking to keep their growing operation discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Abusive OG is as enjoyable when shared with friends as it is when savored during some introspective solo time. However you enjoy this bud, though, don’t plan on getting much accomplished after you partake.\n"

        "description": "Hawaiian Punch is a pure sativa that delivers a knockout of wired cerebral energy. It is derived from a Hawaiian sativa landrace and was stabilized by Sagarmatha Seeds, the same Amsterdam-based breeders responsible for Bubbleberry and Yumboldt. With a tropical citrus flavor and a strong, long-lasting high, Hawaiian Punch deserves a spot on any sativa lover’s bucket list. Its psychoactivity has been measured at between 15 and 25% THC.Hawaiian Punch is marked by medium-sized flowers that have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. These wispy buds have the loose structure often associated with sativas. Leaves are fluffy and can be easily torn away from their central stems. The leaves are a mossy shade of green and are shot through with curly light yellow and orange pistils. Icy white trichomes blanket the flowers, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity and giving them a sticky texture; because of its high resin production on top of its soft, loose structure, Hawaiian Punch may be difficult to break up without a grinder.Like the packaged fruit juice of the same name, Hawaiian Punch smells bright and tangy. Tropical notes of melon and pineapple waft up from the cured flowers, mingling with a sharp lemon zing. Refreshingly for those who are used to smoking indicas or hybrids, this strain is devoid of dank, skunky aromas. When combusted it burns with a smooth, easy smoke and tastes like clean citrus on the exhale. Tokers should enjoy this strain in a joint or a freshly-cleaned pipe to properly savor its unique taste.Hawaiian Punch has a high that hits right away, indeed punching users with the force of its sativa energy. Smokers detect an initial pressure around the eyes and temples, accompanied by a sudden increase in rapid thought association. What follows is a strong, long-lasting feeling of focus that’s great for concentrating on complex analytical tasks. This positive, clearheaded feeling can also illuminate mundane chores like cleaning or grocery shopping. For some, Hawaiian Punch’s rapid “mind race” can be disorienting, but in the right set and setting, it can provide a positive psychedelic experience and an alternately introspective and awestruck attitude. For those who feel the need to burn off this strain’s surge of energy, active physical pursuits are encouraged. The strain’s sense of wonder can be right at home during an extended hike. It can also bring intense new dimensions to activities like exercise and sex. Unburdened by couch-lock or heavy sedative effects, smokers report a sustained euphoria that can facilitate sociability and free-flowing conversation with like-minded (or similarly intoxicated) friends. Hawaiian Punch’s effect are said to be particularly long-lasting, even for experienced cannabis consumers. A consummate, wake-and-bake strain, this bud is best enjoyed during the day, as its buzzy effects will likely keep users awake at bedtime.Hawaiian Punch can have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its ability to engender deep focus can aid those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on single tasks. Its mood-elevating properties can temporarily alleviate the acute symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically, the strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may relieve everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because of its patterns of intense, recursive thinking, Hawaiian Punch is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or anxiety or who have a low THC tolerance.Although Sagarmatha has listed seeds of Hawaiian Punch for sale online, their availability is inconsistent. Home growers may need to obtain clipping of the strain from a trusted breeder in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or out in warm, semi-humid climates. Because of this strain’s hardy genes, perfected over generations of selective breeding, Hawaiian Punch may actually fare better and producer higher yields outdoors. Grown indoors, the plants can reach very tall heights if untamed; growers should train them by trimming and pruning back branches early on in the vegetative stage. This sativa flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a yield of about 33 grams (or 1.2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Like Jamaican and Thai, Hawaiian Punch is a testament to the power of indigenous cannabis plants. Its potency is a gift to cannabis veterans and a strong initiation test for relative newcomers.\n"

        "description": "Cherry Skunk is a slightly indica-dominant hybrid that delivers balanced mental and physical effects. The strain is a cross between Skunk Dawg and the rare Poppa Cherry, and carries all the full-bodied aroma of both parent strains. Its versatility makes this a great all-purpose hybrid that’s right at home in solo and social settings and is equally enjoyable whether you’re out and about or relaxing at home. Its THC content has been measured at between 14% and 22%.Cherry Skunk’s buds, though well-formed and spherical, are typically only small to medium in size. These nugs cling together in a dense, solid bud structure characteristic of other indica varieties. The leaves are a dull shade of olive green and are coiled tightly inward towards their central stems. Winding their way through these thick buds are vibrant orange hairs, which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. A dusting of icy white trichomes coats the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, giving them a prominent white sheen and making them very sticky and hard to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, Cherry Skunk’s flowers smell fruity, although have less of a cherry character than you might expect, instead reeking of sweet and tart berries. There are also discernible notes of citrus. Skunk Dawg also passes on a powerfully skunky aroma that undercuts this fruitiness. Meanwhile, breaking apart the buds yields dank notes of earth and spice. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Cherry Skunk burns with a smoke that is smoother than expected, given the strain’s clashing combination of flavor profiles. On the exhale, this smoke tastes sweet with a tinge of acrid skunk. Those consuming the strain in public should take any necessary precautions, as the flowers can be particularly pungent when burnt.Cherry Skunk is marked by a fast-acting high that may reveal itself before smokers have finished savoring the strain’s unique taste. Early effects are evident in the form of sharpened sensory perception -- external stimuli like sights and sounds may be exaggerated and take on new dimensions. In addition to this distortion, users may note that their thoughts take on a more cerebral nature, flowing in a freely-associative succession. Surging feelings of euphoria may be common at these stages as well. For some, Cherry Skunk can have a psychedelic edge, embodied by effects like a strong sense of time dilation. Such trippy effects can inspired creativity under the right circumstances. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, physical relaxation spreads down from the neck, through the core and limbs. Although intractable couch-lock is rare, smokers may find their previously cerebral mindset eclipsed by cloudy daydreaming. Cherry Skunk’s wide-ranging effects are as enjoyable during the day as they are at night.Many medical cannabis patients can also benefit from this hybrid’s spectrum of effects. It is widely praised for conferring pain relief, both for temporary aches and for chronic, serious ailments. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe everyday irritations like nausea and headaches. Cherry Skunk’s easygoing euphoria may also temporarily blunt the symptoms of stress, depression, and even PTSD. Because its head high, though intense, does not often lead to paranoia, this can be a good strain for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial breeders have made seeds of this potent strain available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of Cherry Skunk in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best practices specific to cultivation of this strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Furthermore, the hybrid’s indica leanings imply that its plants grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branches; growers should regularly “top” their crops, trimming away broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes.Somewhat difficult to come by, Cherry Skunk is worth picking up for its robust taste and its calming, evenhanded effects. It’s enjoyable in social or solo settings; if you do break it out in public, though, bring enough to share, as this pungent bud is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Cherry OG is a landrace-driven hybrid with well-balanced effects and an earthy, fruity flavor. This strain comes to us from Emerald Triangle Seeds, the producers also responsible for Emerald Jack. It is a cross between a Thai sativa and an Afghani indica that was backcrossed with its original Thai mother and then crossed again with lemony hybrid Lost Coast OG. A great choice for either all-day productivity or mellow introspection, Cherry OG has a potency that has been measured at between 10% and 23% THC.Cherry OG boasts impressively large buds that adhere in a dense, indica-typical structure. These oversized flowers are almost conical in shape, broad at the base and distinctly pointed at the end. The tightly-packed leaves are an earthy shade of olive green and are shot through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover the nugs, making them very sticky difficult to break up without the use of a quality grinder.When properly cured, Cherry OG’s flowers indeed give off faintly floral, cherry notes. On closer inspection, there is also an astringent aroma reminiscent of gasoline, passed on from the Chemdawg in parent strain Lost Coast OG’s genetics. Also lurking underneath is a slightly citric, sour tang. Meanwhile, grinding up these resinous flowers speaks to Cherry OG’s Afghani heritage, with hashy, incense-like odors that almost overwhelm the traces of berry. When combusted, this bud burns with a smooth and easy smoke that tastes like subtle cherry and blueberry with some added diesel fumes on the exhale.Cherry OG offers what can be described as a creeper of a high, steadily mounting until smokers can’t help but succumb to its effects. Along with a pressure at the front of the head, users may detect an onset of rapid thought association. This head buzz is good for focusing on tasks as complicated as sorting your inbox or as mundane as taking on spring cleaning. The mental energy can also very social in the right set and setting, lending itself to camaraderie and flowing, stimulating conversation. Unlike some hybrids in which the strain’s indica side emerges in a second, distinct phase, Cherry OG seems to offer a consistently balanced high, with a pervasive feeling of relaxation throughout. Couch-lock is not commonly reported, and lucidity is long-lasting. If you’re feeling active and outdoorsy, the strain can set the stage for a long nature walk; under more relaxed circumstances, simply zone out and enjoy a good album or movie. Because of its versatility, Cherry OG is appropriate for use during the daytime or evening -- however, smokers should refrain from enjoying this strain just before bed, as its thoughtful effects may keep them wired and alert.Cherry OG’s wide-reaching effects can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. It can provide effective analgesic relief for aches and pains, whether they’re mild and temporary or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Its sustained positive energy can also combat the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression, helping users to spend their time more mindfully. In some cases, the strain’s lucid clear-headedness may be of use to patients with attention deficit disorders. Finally, Cherry OG is known to provoke hunger, making a good supplement for those who have lost their appetites to sever illness or medication. Although well-balanced, Cherry OG’s cerebral effects may prove disorienting for some, and it is not recommended for users who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Emerald Triangle has made seeds of Cherry OG available for sale online. In can be grown indoors or outdoors in consistently warm, semi-humid climates; that said, the strain’s hardy landrace genes make it somewhat resistant to adverse conditions like variations in temperature and humidity. Plants of Cherry OG lean sativa and can reach lofty heights -- those growing indoors should be sure to train their crops early on via pruning and trimming. Also characteristically sativa is Cherry’s OG’s long flowering time: it flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors.Cherry OG’s versatile, middle-of-the-road effects are a great option for season cannabis consumers who want to experience the best of both indica and sativa effects. It is as enjoyable while out with friends as it is when kicking back at home.\n"

        "description": "Charlie Sheen is a sativa-dominant hybrid that combines the best of both indica and sativa varietals. The strain is a three-way cross between three household names: Green Crack, OG Kush, and Blue Dream. Like its volatile namesake, the bud explodes with fast-paced energy. Fortunately for indica fans, Charlie Sheen also has a soothing, relaxing vibe as the high wears on. Psychoactivity has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Charlie Sheen sets itself apart with large, conical flowers. These long cones have the loose bud structure usually associated with sativas. The fluffy, ragged buds are composed of leaves that are easily torn away from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green. Some phenotypes of the strain also boast patches of muted purple; these surprising colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold weather during vegetation in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. These already-colorful buds are coated on their inner and outer surfaces in cloudy white trichomes, giving them a silvery sheen.Cured flowers of Charlie Sheen burst with a bright lemon and orange aroma that is faintly redolent of citrus-scented cleaning products. Closer inspection also reveals a grassy, vegetal character. Meanwhile, breaking these loose flowers up yields some skunky and incense-like notes that betray the strain’s Kushy roots. Charlie Sheen burns with a smooth, palatable smoke when combusted; this smoke tastes like overripe sweet fruit with a slightly dank, piney undercurrent.Charlie Sheen takes effect quickly, bringing about a rush of uplifting energy. Users may find themselves in the midst of strong cerebral thinking; this mindset can be good for finding analytical solutions to problems, as well as creative brainstorming. The strain can also be uniquely social and can serve as a conversational lubricant. In the right set and setting, these early phases of the high may create a soaring feeling of euphoria. After an hour or so, users are struck by a strong body high. Eyelids may droop while the limbs and core start to feel heavy, leading many to seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. This deep relaxation can feel disorienting and may cause users to feel depersonalized or disconnected from control of their bodies. Although fun and psychedelic, these sensations may prove scary for some. As smokers become couch-locked, their minds can wander and enter a foggy, cloudy state -- don’t plan on getting anything done a few hours after consuming. Charlie Sheen is most appropriate for use during the late afternoon or evening. This strain can also have application for medical cannabis patients. Its ability to boost mood can be beneficial for those with mild to moderate stress or depression, helping them to spend their time more presently and consciously. Charlie Sheen’s later numbing effects may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Finally, in high enough doses, the bud acts against even stubborn cases of insomnia. Because its early cerebral effects are associated with an out-of-control feeling of “mind race,” Charlie Sheen is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial breeders have taken credit for creating Charlie Sheen, and as such, no seeds of the strain are available for sale online. Prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little specific information available on best practices for cultivating this hybrid, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, growers looking to bring out Charlie Sheen’s striking purple hues should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.It may not be as potent as tiger blood (whatever that is), but Charlie Sheen nevertheless delivers considerable mental and physical effects. It’s a great option for squeezing in some productivity before winding down at the end of a long day.\n"

        "description": "Tutti Frutti is a strain that’s tailor-made for sativa lovers who value flavor as much as they do potency. This hybrid was created as a combination of some outstanding genetics, including Green Haze, Blue Haze, a Thai landrace, and Diesel. The brainchild of Flash Seeds, a prolific group of breeders based in Spain, Tutti Frutti offers a strong, buzzy head high and a smoke that’s bursting with flavor. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 23%.Tutti Frutti is marked by medium to large-sized buds that maintain the dense, tightly-packed structure characteristic of indica varieties. Besides being particularly large, Tutti Frutti’s flowers also have a uniquely elongated, egg-like shape. The tightly-packed leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are threaded through with dark, rust-colored pistils. Finally, a thick coating of translucent amber trichomes covers the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces, giving them a yellow sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Tutti Frutti’s fruity, tropical appeal is almost immediately obvious. A sweet citrus and berry character wafts up from the buds. Meanwhile, the strain’s double dose of Haze is evident in a strong herbal scent with some discernible notes of lavender. Breaking open or grinding up the buds yields a deep, astringent odor similar to gasoline or ammonia. Despite a mostly sweet flavor profile, Tutti Frutti gives off an acrid smoke that can be harsh on the lungs and sinuses. This smoke tastes sweetly floral with a sting of diesel on the exhale.Tutti Frutti provides what can best be described as a creeper of a high; it may be several minutes after smokers have finished toking before its effects are fully felt. When the strain does kick in, users will notice increased mental activity. At first, this stimulation works on the senses, making certain sights, sounds, and even tastes seem more vivid and memorable. As users adjust to this altered perception, they typically find themselves following a careening train of thought. Such cerebral thinking can lend itself to complex problem solving scenarios, as well as more free-form creative brainstorming. In the right set and setting, this strain allows users to remain clearheaded and lucid, and can also create strong feelings of euphoria. As the high wears on, more pronounced physical effects emerge. Smokers may find themselves free from muscular tension and mental stress, and they may even be more likely to spring for a spot on the closest couch -- that said, couch-lock is uncommon, and users are not often physically incapacitated. Tutti Frutti can also be a strong appetite stimulant, giving users an excuse to indulge their chemically-altered palates. A quintessential wake-and-bake strain, Tutti Frutti is great for active pursuits like hiking or running errands; its potent cerebral effects may be less welcome at night, when they are likely to keep users wired before bed.Tutti Frutti can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained feeling of focus may be of use to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on a single task. It can also have powerful mood-altering effects, helping those with mild to moderate stress and depression to spend their time more presently and mindfully. Latent physical effects can serve as an analgesic for deep-seated aches and pains, while the strain’s ability to induce hunger can aid patients who have lost their appetites to disease or to painful treatments like chemotherapy. Because it may make some users feel as if their minds are racing out of control, those who are prone to panic should consume this strain with caution and moderation.Although Flash at one point sold seeds of Tutti Frutti online, the strain no longer appears to be stocked for sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available regarding specific best cultivation practices for this strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. We also know that it flowers within 7 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Tutti Frutti is a great way to start your day with a blast of energy and then taper down into full-bodied relaxation. The strain’s sweet, floral smoke also makes it particularly fun to share with like-minded friends.\n"

        "description": "Willy Wonka is a sativa-dominant strain with a smooth yet energetic high that’s great for cannabis novices. Created by Spanish seed company Mr. Natural, this hybrid is a cross between the Thai-descended Chocolate Trip and famed Cinderella 99. With a robust flavor and powerful effects, it’s no wonder that a concentrate produced from Willy Wonka took home honors in the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup in Denver. This strain scores consistently high marks for potency -- cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 found multiple samples of Willy Wonka to have between 20% and 28% THC.Flowers of Willy Wonka tend to be on the smaller side. The nugs, which cling together in a dense, clustered bud structure, are broad at their base and taper into a spade-like point. Hairy red pistils twist their way through the tightly-packed leaves. The leaves themselves are what really make Willy Wonka stand out -- a mossy green, they are often mottled with deep shades of purple. These surprising hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics. When agitated by cold weather, these pigments create shades of blue and purple in much the same way that depleted chlorophyll levels cause foliage to change color in autumn. Finally, much like the similarly alliterative strain White Widow, Willy Wonka is covered in a blanket of translucent white trichomes that account for its psychoactivity.The sharp smell of citrus wafts up from cured flowers of Willy Wonka; many smokers also detect distinct notes of apricot in its aroma. Underlying this fruity bouquet is a dank base of pine and damp earth. Breaking open the buds also reveals hints of musk. When combusted, Willy Wonka burns with a smooth smoke that’s easy on the lungs and sinuses. Appropriately enough, this sweet smoke tastes like rich cocoa on the exhale; Willy Wonka himself would doubtless be proud of this unique mix of flavors.Something of a creeper, Willy Wonka may take several minutes before its effects begin to emerge. A slight distortion of sight and vision is accompanied by surging feelings of euphoria. Endowed with a burst of energy, smokers may feel moved to engage with their surroundings, making this a great strain for exercise. The strain’s lasting feeling of focus can also set the mood for work productivity, whether you’re in a creative or a more analytical field. In social settings, Willy Wonka can inspire intense, engaging conversations with like-minded companions. As the high wears on, users may feel a slight tingle or a mounting sense of relaxation -- but this bud isn’t likely to bring about inescapable couch-lock. A great choice for daytime use, Willy Wonka is just what the doctor ordered for a soothing wake-and-bake session; consumed at night, it’s more likely to keep smokers buzzed and alert before bed. For those with a high THC tolerance, Willy Wonka’s effects tend to taper off relatively early.Willy Wonka can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its clear-minded lucidity can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders, greatly improving focus. Its ability to elevate mood can also temporarily relieve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because its physical effects are more subtle, Willy Wonka can be great for mild irritations like headaches or nausea but may not work as well in soothing chronic, nerve-related pain. Because its initial are energetic without being overly cerebral, this strain can be a great choice for those who are prone to panic.Mr. Natural has made seeds of Willy Wonka available online, but the company only ships orders within Spain; prospective growers elsewhere will need to obtain clippings from healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Willy Wonka can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degree Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out the leaves’ eye-catching purple streaks should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least ten to fifteen degrees colder than average. Willy Wonka flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It’s also known to be a high yielder.An agreeable, low-key sativa hybrid, Willy Wonka is versatile enough for use alone or with a large group of friends. For a full Charlie and the Chocolate Factory-themed smoke session, pair this strain with the more balanced Golden Ticket.\n"

        "description": "24K Gold (aka 24 Karat Gold and sometimes Kosher Tangie) is an indica-dominant hybrid, although its long-lasting physical effects seem almost exclusively sativa. Created by high-profile breeders DNA Genetics -- the same people behind Chocolope and LA Confidential -- this strain is a cross between award-winning Kosher Kush and sativa favorite Tangie. In addition to a standout citrus flavor profile, 24K Gold impresses with colorful, eye-catching flowers. This hybrid’s potency has been measured at between 15% and an impressive 24%; it may not be the best choice for cannabis novices.24K Gold is marked by medium to large flowers. Depending on the phenotype, these buds range from almost spherical to tapered and spade-shaped. Across the board, though, the flowers adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. The leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are threaded through with rust-colored pistils. A translucent coat of trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of the blossoms, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity and giving it an icy white sheen. The smell of fresh citrus and orange zest jumps off of cured flowers of 24K Gold. On closer inspection, a whiff of pine and musk is also lurking underneath. Meanwhile, breaking open these dense buds yields notes of spicy and incense, betraying this hybrid’s Hindu Kush landrace roots. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, 24K Gold burns with a smoke that’s uncommonly smooth despite being thick and lung-expanding. This smoke tastes fruity with a peppery kick on the exhale; this combination of flavors may taste bitter to some users.The high from 24K Gold hits quickly for an indica. Almost immediately after exhaling a bowlful, smokers may detect a slight throbbing at the front of the forehead. This sensation is accompanied by a sharpening of the senses -- external stimuli like sights and sounds may seem to be amplified, making this strain perfect for enjoying some atmospheric music or a visually engaging movie. Some users may experience slightly psychedelic effects like time dilation or visual distortions.24K Gold comes with few productive cerebral effects: while smokers may be able to carry on a lucid conversation, they tend to become dreamy and dopey, and certainly not equipped to execute complex tasks. Instead, share this easygoing buzz with some friends and let the laughs or conversation flow. As time passes or as dosage is increased, a more intense phase of physical sedation begins. Smokers commonly slide into body melt and couch-lock and can remain content for hours, given a few creature comforts. Because of its predominantly lazy vibes, 24K Gold is more appropriate for nighttime than daytime use.Medical cannabis patients may also benefit from 24K Gold’s sedative properties. The bud can be an effective pain reliever, whether users suffer from temporary aches or more chronic, nerve-related discomfort. Its anti-inflammatory effects can also relieve everyday irritations like headaches and stomach trouble. In high enough doses, this strain’s thorough, almost narcotic relaxation may lull insomniacs into a deep, restful sleep. Psychologically speaking, 24K Gold temporarily blunts the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should note that, although recursive, paranoid thinking is not commonly reported, this variety’s body high can be so intense as to prove disorienting and overwhelming.Fortunately for home growers, DNA Genetics has made seeds of 24K Gold available for sale online. This strain is considered a temperamental grow, and may not be the best choice for newcomers to cultivation. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a warm, semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight. As is typical of sativas, this strain can grow to be very tall -- those growing indoors should train their plants by pruning and cutting them back early in the vegetative stage. 24K Gold has a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. It offers patient growers a solid yield of 42 to 51 grams (or 1.5 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.24K Gold is just the thing for veteran indica fans seeking a pleasant, full-flavored smoke. It’s a great choice whether you’re feeling particularly social and chatty or just spending some introspective time alone.\n"

        "description": "3x Crazy (or 3x Times Crazy, and sometimes known as Optimus Prime) is an indica-dominant hybrid that packs a serious punch. Its name is reference to its genetics, a three-way cross between OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and Granddaddy Purple. These powerhouse strains combine to create a balanced strain that offers cerebral effects upfront and a heavy physical relaxation on the backend. Aside from a colorful and fragrant bag appeal, 3x Crazy has potency to boot: its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 23%.If the name of this indica doesn’t catch your attention, its large, colorful flowers will. The buds are solid and nearly spherical in shape. They hold the dense bud structure usually associated with indicas. The coiled leaves are a mossy shade of green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. More often than not, phenotypes of 3x Crazy also exhibit patches of muted purple and blue in equal proportion to green. These surprising colors are the result of pigments called anthocyanins -- passed on from parent strain Granddaddy Purple --  that bring out different hues when agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, the mottled flowers are covered in unusually large, translucent white trichomes that give the buds a sticky texture and an icy gloss.When properly cured, 3x Crazy smells fruity and sweet, with a mixed grape and berry character. On closer inspection, there is also a smoky, earthy scent, with notes of sap and pine lurking underneath this fruity bouquet. Breaking open the buds yields some spice and incense, a testament to the OG Kush in this variety’s background. When combusted, 3x Crazy burns with a smooth and easily ingested smoke that tastes clean and fruity on the exhale. Notably, any discernible grape flavors are coincidental to this strain’s purple leaves; while its color is determined by pigmentation, its aroma is dictated by separate botanical compounds called terpenes. 3x Crazy can be a particularly pungent smoke, so tokers who are preoccupied with discretion should take the needed precautions.3x Crazy is known to offer a creeper of a high, and may require several minutes before beginning to reveal its effects. Smokers will eventually detect a bracing pressure at the front of the head and around the temples. Around the same time, thoughts may begin to flow more freely and easily. The ensuing mental lucidity is a good primer for work that requires analysis, creativity, and concentration. Within an hour or so, this head high settles into a more sedate feeling of physical relaxation. Waves of soothing contentment spread down from the neck through the spine and extremities. Many users report feeling grounded (rather than disoriented) by these relaxing effects. The body may tip over into an intractable sense of couch-lock for the duration of the high. Despite this sedation, though, 3x Crazy can be a remarkably social high, inspiring conversation and provoking fits of giggles. This strain is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening, when its backslide into sleepy meditation can be fully appreciated.3x Crazy may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Although short-lived, its cerebral effects can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain some concentration. Meanwhile, its numbing indica effects can relieve aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic and nerve-related. The bud’s mood-elevating properties can also take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Finally, in large enough doses, 3x Crazy can lull insomniacs into a deep, fulfilling sleep. Because this strain’s mental effects do not commonly lead to recursive, paranoid thinking, it can be a good option for patients who are prone to panic.Unfortunately, no commercial breeders have made seeds of 3x Crazy for sale online; prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to cultivate genetically identical “clones.” Plants can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, almost Mediterranean climate. The plants grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branches, and are easily accommodated indoors. Those looking to bring out the bud’s signature blue and purple hues should also briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average. 3x Crazy flowers within 7 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.3x Crazy is an ideal hybrid for sativa fans who’d like a dash of cerebral thinking along with their body melt. You don’t have to be crazy yourself to enjoy this strain -- but it certainly won’t hurt.\n"

        "description": "Bubbleberry is a balanced hybrid created by Sagarmatha Seeds, a group of Amsterdam-based breeders who have created flavorful strains like Yumboldt. A cross between Bubblegum and favorite hybrid Blueberry, Bubbleberry offers a well-rounded high that combines the best of indica and sativa effects. It also has the full-bodied aroma that you’d expect of parent strain Blueberry. A crowd-pleaser for cannabis novices and veterans alike, this strain won the 1998 San Francisco Bay Area Growers’ Award. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of Bubbleberry to have between 14% and 20% THC.Bubbleberry sets itself apart with medium to large-sized flowers that are spade-shaped, tapering from a broad base down into a pointed end. The buds cling together in a densely-packed, indica-typical formation. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are shot through with twisted brown and orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from male fertilizing plants). A scattering of translucent amber trichomes lends some stickiness, as well as a slightly yellow hue.When properly cured, Bubbleberry gives off a sweet and fruity aroma. The scent of blueberry mingles with a tangy citrus odor. When the flowers are broken open, they yield some eye-watering, skunky notes. When Bubbleberry is burnt in a pipe or a joint, its scents come together in an acrid, stinky smoke that is likely to induce coughing. On the exhale, Bubbleberry leaves behind a sweet, overripe taste with slight hints of chocolate. This can be a particularly pungent smoke -- those looking to keep their toking discreet should take any needed precautions.The high from Bubbleberry takes hold quickly. Shortly after savoring this strain’s rich, fruity taste, smokers sense a pressure around the eyes and temples. Thoughts may take on a cerebral character and jump from one to the next in free association; for some, this mental stimulation can feel like “mind race.” In the right set and setting, though, users can embrace Bubbleberry’s psychedelic intensity and enjoy its amplified sensory distortion by listening to trippy music or watching an engaging movie. The strain also lends itself to some early productivity, allowing smokers to work on creative or analytical tasks. Within a few hours, this head high devolves into a palpable feeling of body melt: smokers may feel their eyes and jowls droop as limbs feel heavy. This sedated buzz is better suited to spending a night in than being out and about. Couch-lock aside, Bubbleberry’s combination of mental acuity and physical coordination can be a great accompaniment to activities like video games and even sex. This variety is most appropriate for use during the late afternoon or early evening, as its later sedative effects are best enjoyed indoors. A little bit of this bud tends to go a long way, and its effects tend to last longer than average.Bubbleberry’s wide-ranging effects can also have several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its elevation of mood can provide some temporary relief from stress and depression. Its early cerebral nature can also aid those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to focus on business at hand. The strain’s sedative, almost narcotic properties can be an effective balm for deep-seated aches and pains, while its anti-inflammatory properties may relieve more everyday irritations like headaches. In high enough doses, Bubbleberry can combat even stubborn cases of insomnia. Because its onset is associated with intense, recursive thinking, this strain may not be the best option for those who are prone to panic.Fortunately for home growers, Sagarmatha has made seeds of Bubbleberry available for sale online. It can be cultivated indoors or out, although successful outdoor growing requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. It flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and typically offers a low yield of about 28 to 33 grams (or 1 to 1.2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Finally, plants can be pungent before they’re even fully mature, and those who’d like to keep their growing operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Bubbleberry’s balanced effects are fun whether you’re consuming solo or with a group of like-minded friends. If you do bring out your stash around others, be prepared to share, as its unique aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Not a strain for the faint of heart (or palate), Raw Diesel is a powerful and pungent hybrid. Created by G13 Labs, the purveyors of Gigabud, this well-balanced strain is a cross between local favorite NYC Diesel and G13 Haze. With serious bag appeal and a long-lasting high to back it up, it’s no wonder Raw Diesel if so popular. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 13% and 19%.\n\nThis well-bred bud’s flowers tend to be larger in size, a long and tapered shape, somewhat like miniature cypress trees. They maintain a sativa-influenced bud structure, with fluffy-looking leaves that spiral loosely outward from their central stems. The leaves are a pale sea green and exist in almost equal proportion to dark brown hairs, which are actually botanical reproductive structures called pistils. Finally, a high volume of translucent white trichomes coats all visible surfaces of these large flowers, accounting for their very sticky texture.  \n\nOn initial inspection, Raw Diesel passes on its unmistakable astringent aroma of gasoline. There are also some earthy base notes, suggestive of damp soil. Grinding up the flowers yields a spicy herbal scent often associated with grandparent strain Haze. When burned, Raw Diesel releases an acrid, stinging smoke that’s liable to sting the eyes or palate. On the exhale, this harsh smoke tastes like diesel fumes with some lingering sweet and sour funk.\n\nRaw Diesel’s high zooms right into the user’s head, boosting blood flow to the temples and causing mild side effects like increased salivation and a flushing in the cheeks. What comes after is an uplifted mental state in which any earlier concerns are pushed to the side. Instead, consumers typically experience an uplift in their cerebral functioning, stopping to dwell on ideas or concepts that might otherwise interest them. The bud can also provoke a sped-up kind of “mindrace” in which thoughts flow from one to the next in bizarre associations. Raw Diesel’s tendency to amplify inner monologues can make it a useful social lubricant, helping conversation flow in party settings. While potent, this mental stimulation tends not to last very long, and those looking to take advantage of it by plowing through a to-do list should plan accordingly. After relatively little time, Raw Diesel’s vibe becomes less focused and slowly more relaxing. While it may not necessarily enable them to accomplish any complicated, analytical tasks, smokers may find that this cloudy, laid-back energy is a great way to enjoy some introspective solo time. As time passes or as dosage is increased, this strain’s palpable body high may progress into entrenched couch-lock, leaving consumers able to pull little more than a binge-watching (or eating) session. Because of its two-stage high, Raw Diesel is best enjoyed in the afternoon or evening, especially on a day when the smoker has no set agenda. Beware that if toked right before bed, this bud is liable to keep users wide awake.\n\nRaw Diesel’s versatile properties also make it a good treatment for some medical cannabis patients. The bud’s focused, cerebral onset may be of use to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to focus on a single task. Its mental uplift can also soothe the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Raw Diesel’s subtle body high may dull aches and pains that are due to disease or injury, while its anti-inflammatory effects can take care of common irritations like indigestion. Because of its fast-paced, recursive patterns of thinking, Raw Diesel should be consumed with caution and in moderation by patients who are prone to paranoia or who have a low THC tolerance.\n\nG13 Labs has made seeds of Raw Diesel available online. This hardy, resilient strain may be a good option for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a hot and semi-humid climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy and provide gardeners with a medium yield at harvest time.\n\nRaw Diesel makes for a good middle-of-the-road smoke for those who don’t want to be totally overwhelmed by cerebral sativa effects. If you’re enjoying it in public, beware that its trademark pungency may just attract some unwanted attention.\n\n"

Created by rappers Kurupt and Dr. Zodiak, Moonrocks are sizable cannabis buds that have been soaked in concentrated hash oil and then rolled in kief. And although Moonrocks can be made from buds of virtually any strain, sativa favorite Sour Diesel contains enough psychoactive potency and acrid flavor to shine through the thick layers of concentrate and kief involved in this preparation.Although shaped roughly like raw cannabis flowers, Sour Moonrocks may be almost unrecognizable to frequent smokers. The nuggets are bright green thanks to their thorough coating of resin. Sour Moonrocks are also heavier than even the densest, most solid indica buds, due to their coagulated combination of plant matter, oil, and kief. Unfortunately for connoisseurs of aromatic profiles, very little of Sour D’s signature pungency comes through on initial inspection.Rather than breaking these well-crafted rocks up with a grinder, consumers should carefully break off small pieces at a time -- preferably with a pair of slim, sturdy tweezers, so as to rub off as little precious kief as possible. Similarly, consumers should enjoy pieces of moonrock in a piece with a deep and sturdy bowl; a hash pipe would work particularly well. Sour Moonrocks burns slowly, thanks to its wealth of combustible material. Its flavor is a meld of Sour Diesel’s skunky, chemical taste and some distinctly rich, incense-like notes courtesy of the concentrated hash oil. The high from this delicacy is strong and multi-dimensional. Those lucky enough to have tried it report a strong cerebral edge, thanks to Sour Diesel’s predominantly sativa genetics. The addition of hash oil and kief, however, lend a palpable body high as well, liable to keep smokers pinned in place while still mentally engaged. Sour Moonrocks is of use to both recreational and medical users, thanks to its combination of mental and physical effects. It can be a mind-expanding and psychedelic experience, as well as a numbing and therapeutic high.Truly the ‘turducken’ of cannabis products, Sour Moonrocks offers both visual interest and dynamic effects. Although it is currently only available for sale in select California facilities, the intrepid smoker can create a DIY version of Sour Moonrocks armed with some bud of Sour Diesel and this handy guide.\n"

        "description": "Syrup OG is an indica-dominant hybrid that leans on a powerful genetic legacy. It is a cross between Cookies and the infamous OG Kush -- not just any OG Kush, though; the first Syrup OG’s mother plant was a clone taken from an original OG Kush plant dating from the 1970s. With such a prestigious background, it’s hard for this strain to disappoint. It offers long-lasting relaxation, although not without some measure of mental stimulation. Not only did Syrup OG win the title of Best Indica in the 2014 Hempcon Kush Cup hosted in San Bernardino, California, it was also recognized as having the Highest Terpene Count in the 2015 Chalice Cup. Syrup OG’s THC content has been measured at as high as a jaw-dropping 33%.Syrup OG distinguishes itself with impressively large flowers. These chunky buds are rounded in shape, if not exactly spherical. They cling together in a very dense, tightly-packed formation, typical of so many other indica varieties. The flowers’ tightly-curling leaves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are threaded through with a preponderance of pale brown pistils. Finally, the “syrup” in this strain’s name refers to its high production of sticky, syrupy resin -- and indeed, these buds are coated in translucent amber trichomes that give them a dewy appearance and account for the strain’s high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Syrup OG explodes with woodsy notes of pine and cedar. Less pleasant and lurking underneath this earthy bouquet is a tangy, skunky odor. When broken apart or ground up, Syrup OG’s dense flowers give off notes of spice and incense, likely passed on from the Hindu Kush indica landrace in parent strain OG Kush’s lineage. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, this strain gives off a pungent, acrid smoke that may be hard on the lungs and induce coughing. On the exhale, however, this thick smoke has a festive, almost Christmas-y taste, with a clean and peppery pine finish. Syrup OG offers a slow, creeping high that may take several minutes before beginning to reveals its effects. At first, smokers may notice a feeling thickness on the tongue, as well as a mounting heaviness in the eyelids and around the temples. Soon after, waves of relaxation spread down from the neck and through the core and limbs. Despite these mellow effects, however, users are still able to maintain a lucid train of thought. Under the right circumstances, some may even find themselves stimulated by their surroundings into a sublime state of creativity. Syrup OG can be great for working on imaginative, artistic projects, or for kicking off an innovative, free-associative round of brainstorming. As time wears on or as dosage is increased, the likelihood of couchlock increases. If they have on other obligations, smokers will be content to remain motionless while enjoying a snack or a particularly trippy movie. Syrup OG’s easygoing, relaxing vibes are just as enjoyable with friends as they are in isolated solo settings. Because of the strain’s backslide into sedation -- or even sleep -- this bud is recommended for use during the early evening or nighttime.This strain’s calming effects can also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Because it contains small amounts CBD, the compound in cannabis that amplifies its therapeutic physical effects, Syrup OG is an effective means of relief for those suffering from chronic, disease-related pain. As noted, in high enough doses, it can also lull users to sleep, thus serving as a handy aid for insomniacs. Psychologically speaking, the strain’s soothing energy may temporarily numb the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Because it does not often result in the kind recursive cerebral thinking that leads to paranoia, Syrup OG is recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No large-scale breeders have made seeds of Syrup OG available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best cultivation practices for this specific strain, we know that, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in warm, semi-humid climates. Additionally, the strain’s indica roots suggest that its plants grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branches, and are easily accommodated in indoor growing spaces using the “sea of green” growing technique.Enjoy Syrup OG for its plentiful, award-winning terpene profile. On top of its standout flavor, the strain’s thorough feeling of relaxation can be a great way to wind down after a long day.\n"

        "description": "Alpha Omega OG is a strain that, despite its high-profile status, remains a bit of a mystery. It was created by Dr. J’s, the prolific Colorado-based company responsible for several potent edible creations. Alpha Omega OG’s genetic origins, however, are unknown. Although the “Alpha” in this strain’s name may suggest descent from sativa Alpha Blue (itself a cross between Blue Dream and NYC Diesel), other sources name San Fernando Valley OG and Dr. J’s own Super OG Kush as parents. Ultimately, only precise independent testing or documentation from Dr. J’s can confirm the strain’s roots. Whatever its lineage, Alpha Omega OG is potent and memorable enough to have earned eighth place on L.A. Weekly’s 2016 roundup of the 10 Best Marijuana Strains at L.A. Dispensaries.Those who have been lucky enough to sample Alpha Omega OG praise the strain’s tasty combination of pine and dank, kushy flavors and its smooth, palatable smoke. This bud’s high is characterized as more indica than sativa -- it creates a calm, trancelike mindset that’s more hazy and dreamy than it is exacting and cerebral. Euphoria and increased creativity are also reported, while the strain’s medical uses include appetite stimulation and chronic pain relief.Somewhat difficult to come by outside of Southern California, Alpha Omega OG is worth sampling if spotted on dispensary shelves. Be warned that this bud’s potency may come at a steep cost, though -- Alpha Omega OG reportedly sells for as much as $72 per ? of an ounce.\n"

        "description": "Although its name should prepare smokers for its startling mish-mash of flavors, Cheese Candy is nevertheless a popular hybrid. Created by Delicious Seeds, the same prolific breeders responsible for tasty strains like Cotton Candy Kush, this hybrid is a cross between staple strain Cheese and Delicious’ own sweet and fruity Caramelo. Aside from a unique flavor profile -- and a scent that practically bursts through the bag -- Cheese Candy delivers both relaxing and mentally stimulating effects. This bud has won honors in multiple European cannabis competitions -- including the so-called 2017 Secret Cup, held in Naples, Italy. Impressive for both cannabis novices and veterans, Cheese Candy’s THC levels have been measured at between 11% and 20% by cannabis testing lab Analytical 360. This strain is also sometimes known as Delicious Candy.Cheese Candy sets itself apart with medium to large-sized buds. These flowers have an elongated, conical shape and hold together in a relatively dense, solid bud structure. The tightly-packed leaves are a mossy shade of green and are shot through with rust-colored pistils. A coating of cloudy white trichomes is the crowning glory on these standout flowers, and give Cheese Candy a very sticky texture that makes it difficult to break up without the use of a quality grinder.Flowers of Cheese Candy at once present both sugary-sweet and acrid, cheesy aromas. This combination may prove unpleasant for some -- especially considering the strain’s unusual pungency. Breaking up or grinding the flowers also yields some spicy, peppery notes, perhaps owing to the Afghani landrace in parent strain Cheese’s genetics. When burnt, Cheese Candy’s harsh, lung-stinging smoke that tastes tangy and cheesy on the exhale. Smokers enjoying this variety in public should be forewarned that its odor can carry for quite a distance -- anyone concerned with discretion should take the necessary precautions.Cheese Candy takes effect quickly, almost immediately granting users a more acute sense of their surroundings. This sharpened perception, while potentially disorienting at first, lends itself to some psychedelic enjoyment in the right set and setting. At first, smokers may feel giddy and uplifted, finding interest or humor in otherwise mundane situations. These good vibes are right at home in social situations, where they can facilitate easy, free-flowing conversation and camaraderie. Rather than making smokers feel wired and high strung, though, as many other sativa-leaning hybrids are apt to do, Cheese Candy supplies a smooth feeling of physical relaxation that persists throughout the high. Smokers can maintain lucid focus if they so desire, allowing them to perform deliberate, analytical work, as well as more creative, artistic endeavors. As the high wears on, a feeling of deep physical relaxation creeps in, and may even lead to immobilization in very comfortable circumstances. In high enough doses, Cheese Candy can even provoke deep and restful sleep. Appropriate for use at any time of day, this bud is great for both waking-and-baking and unwinding after work.Cheese Candy may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The sense of concentration associated with its onset may be of use to those with attention deficit disorders. The bud’s ability to blunt negative emotions can also temporarily relieve mild to moderate symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Physiologically speaking, this strain may relieve aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. As noted, it can also act against trenchant cases of insomnia. Because a feeling of out-of-control “mindrace” is not often reported as a side effect, Cheese Candy is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Delicious has made seeds of this strain available for sale online. With a naturally high resistance to mold, it is a good choice for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Cheese Candy flowers within 7 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. Plants have a good bud-to-leaf ratio, resulting in good yields with minimal pruning or trimming required. Finally, just as this is a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow, and those looking to keep their growing operations under wraps should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.A versatile hybrid, Cheese Candy is great for either solo or social enjoyment. If you break it out at a party, though, be prepared for some bystanders to object to its unusual, multi-faceted odor.\n"

        "description": "Chocolate Kush is an indica-leaning hybrid marked by its sweet, dessert-like aroma. It was created by Spanish company 00 Seeds, who have stabilized strains like White Widow and Bubble Gum. This strain is a cross between pure indica Mazar and Sensi Star -- these two combine to create a hybrid with serious bag appeal. Chocolate Kush’s potency has been measured at between 14% and 28% THC.Flowers of Chocolate Kush are only small to medium in size and cling together in dense, popcorn-like formations. The buds have the solid, heavy structure typically associated with indicas. The tightly-curled leaves are a mossy shade of green and are shot through with curly orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Occasionally, phenotypes of Chocolate Kush also boast faint shades of purple in their leaves; these surprising hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the plants’ genetics which reveal patches of blue and purple when agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a fine frost of trichomes cover these buds, accounting for their psychoactivity and making them appear more white than green.When properly cured, flowers of Chocolate Kush impress consumers with a dynamic, full-bodied aroma. The primary scent is of sweet, rich cocoa. This chocolatey profile mingles with the dank scent of damp soil to yield an overall earthy impression. When combusted, Chocolate Kush burns with a smooth, palatable smoke; this smoke tastes herbal on the exhale, with a toasted coffee flavor. Notably, despite its purple hues, Chocolate Kush has no discernible notes of grape -- this is because the strain’s vivid coloring is determined by pigments while its flavor is dictated by separate chemical compounds called terpenes. Chocolate Kush’s high has a slow, easy onset that makes it a user-friendly option for cannabis newcomers. Bracing and energizing at first, this strain confers an upbeat feeling that may elevate the smoker’s mood. It may also provoke an increase in thoughtfulness, allowing smokers to work on any tasks at hand with a clear head and deliberate intent. If you’re planning to accomplish work when enjoying Chocolate Kush, though, try and finish up quickly; within an hour or so, smokers typically slide into a thorough feeling of physical relaxation. Limbs may feel heavier as breathing happens more easily and any muscular tension evaporates. In high enough doses, Chocolate Kush may even induce a deep, restful sleep. This flavorful strain is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening, when its gradual steps down from energy into relaxation can be fully savored; if used before bed, it may leave users too hyper-alert. Note that drymouth is commonly reported as a negative side effect.Chocolate Kush may also have application for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sedative effects may relieve pain, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Furthermore, it can have anti-inflammatory effects for soothing headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, this bud may also provide temporary relief from mild to moderate stress or depression. Although cerebral, Chocolate Kush does not typically bring about intense, paranoid thinking; as such, it is recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.00 Seeds has made seeds of Chocolate Kush available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. The plants have a triangular silhouette when fully grown and, depending on whether they’re cultivated indoor or outdoors, can grow to between 3 and 8 feet tall. Growers looking to bring out Chocolate Kush’s full purple potential should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It offers a modest yield of about 33 to 37 grams (1.1 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Chocolate Kush is well-suited to solo introspective use, as well as boisterous social smoking. Whatever the setting, it’s just the thing for winding down after a long day or week.\n"

        "description": "Girl Scout Cookies, one of the most popular strains in circulation today, continues to yield potent child strains and derivatives. Cookie Dough is no exception. A distinct phenotype of Girl Scout Cookies, Cookie Dough (not to be confused with BC Seeds’ Emperor Cookie Dough) offers balanced effects and has a uniquely yeasty flavor profile. A strong and long-lasting strain even for cannabis veterans, Cookie Dough’s potency has been measured at between 13% and 25% THC.Flowers of Cookie Dough assert their bag appeal quickly with medium-sized clusters that adhere in a dense, indica-typical formation. These buds have a roughly spherical shape. The tightly-packed leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are thread through with vibrant orange pistils. Some phenotypes of Cookie Dough even boast hints of purple in their leaves; these surprising colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics are excited by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a dusting of translucent, amber-colored trichomes cover these flowers, giving them a slightly yellow sheen.When cured properly, Cookie Dough’s primary is indeed dough-like, with some bready, yeasty notes. On closer inspection, an acrid funk also lurks underneath. Some hints of berry and citrus liven up the overall impression. When combusted, Cookie Dough burns with a smooth and palatable smoke; this smoke has distinct dough and berry flavors on the exhale. Notably, despite its occasional purple coloring, this strain has no discernible grape aroma -- this is because the pigments that determine the leaves’ coloring do not have a corresponding effect on their taste.Cookie Dough’s high very quickly, smacking users with a sudden pressure around the eyes and temples. As they adjust to this new physical sensation, smokers will notice that their thoughts have taken on an amplified cerebral dimension -- for some, these effects may lead to an unsettling feeling of mindrace. In the right set and setting though, smokers can adjust to this altered perception in time and can coast through the high’s psychedelic edge. Somewhat too potent to allow smokers to accomplish work or errands, Cookie Dough is better for boisterous social enjoyment. Its strong, euphoric buzz can bring about free-flowing conversation as well as fits of the giggles. For a more solo vibe, enjoy this bud with a trippy movie or some mellow, atmospheric music. As the high wears on, Cookie Dough’s indica side emerges, weighing down limbs and eyelids with a weighty, contented relaxation. Ultimately, this strain is more appropriate for daytime or late afternoon use, as the fast-paced effect associated with its onset may be too intense for nighttime.Cookie Dough also has several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its ability to elevate mood can temporarily relieve the difficult symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. To a lesser degree, the strain may also soothe aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. Some anti-inflammatory effects can also take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because its cerebral effects can be particularly strong, Cookie Dough is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Unfortunately, no commercial growers have yet made seeds of Cookie Dough available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of the strain from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on specific best practices for cultivation of this phenotype, we know that its parent strain Girl Scout Cookies can be grown indoors or out, and that it flowers within 9 to 10 weeks. Finally, growers looking to bring out Cookie Dough’s purple potential should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures 10 to 15 degrees below average.Growers should also be sure to preserve this strain’s unique flavor by properly curing their harvest. Curing requires freshly-trimmed buds to be hung upside-down for a week and then sealed in airtight containers, and stored in conditions of 60-65% humidity; as they cure, buds should regularly be checked for mold or mildew.Like its cousin cuts Thin Mints and Animal Cookies, Cookie Dough has built on the strength of its original genetics to offer knockout potency. Savor this bold and strangely-flavored strain alone or with some close, like-minded friends.\n"

        "description": "Named after the legendary jazz pianist and singer, Ray Charles is a bold indica with an undeniable pungency. This bud’s exact genetic background is not well documented, but it’s thought to be a pure indica and descended from an Afghani landrace. What’s clear is that this strain provides knockout relaxation and is best enjoyed as a soothing evening treat. Its THC content has been measures at between 15% and 21%.\n\nRay Charles stands out with large, well-formed flowers that cling together in formations that range from tapered and elongated to roughly spherical. These buds make their indica heritage clear with compact, closely-packed buds and small leaves. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with vibrant orange and rust-colored pistils. Finally, Ray Charles’ impressive flowers are crowned with a coat of icy white trichomes.\n\nWhen properly cured, flowers of Ray Charles give off a sour-sweet funk, somewhat like compost or fertilizer. A second whiff reveals some astringent, almost chemical odors. Grinding up the buds gives off a rich, hashy aroma reminiscent of Afghani. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Ray Charles releases a harsh smoke that may make the user cough or make their eyes water. This smoke has some lingering sweet diesel fumes on the exhale.\n\nEven experienced cannabis consumers may be surprised by how slowly and subtly this bud creeps up. Several minutes after toking, users tend to feel a weightiness in the eyelids and extremities, as well as an increased blood pressure around the temples. Weird sensory phenomena are also reported, including a distortion of depth perception (especially when looking at phone or tablet screens) and a feeling of time moving more slowly. Those who are happy to revel in such psychedelic properties can enhance them with some atmospheric music (maybe some Ray Charles himself) or moody lighting. Ray Charles’ relaxing vibe is more than likely to have consumers heading for the closest comfortable surface where they can remain horizontal for the foreseeable future. This body high can be so potent as to make the smoker feel as if they’re floating or disconnected from different parts of their body. As time wears on, or as dosage is increased, Ray Charles can bring about couch-lock in its truest sense, making the afflicted both unable -- and usually unwilling -- to move or stand. All these immobilizing and calming properties can make the bud a great way to set the tone for a binge-watching session or an intimate gathering with some like-minded friends. Because of its sedative, almost narcotic vibe, this is one bud best enjoyed after dark -- or on a day off when you’d like to sleep in or nap for as long as possible.\nRay Charles’ deeply relaxing properties can have several benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can temporarily relieve the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, or even PTSD. The strain’s body high can also numb physical pain, whether it’s due to injury or to chronic conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. At the right dosage and in properly comfortable conditions, Ray Charles can even lull insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because it’s not likely to bring about long bouts of recursive thinking, this strain is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia, or who have a low THC tolerance.\n\nSeeds of this mellow strain are unfortunately not available for sale online. Instead, prospective growers should obtain clippings of mature plants in order to foster clones. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. This strain’s plants are pure indica, with a short and bushy silhouette that has strong tendency for lateral branching. Ray Charles flowers within a brief 8 to 9 weeks.\n\nAlthough hard to find, this super-sedative bud is a strain worth chasing. For a pleasant and irreverent kick, roll a joint of Ray Charles mixed with some of the more well-balanced Stevie Wonder.\n"

Although popular throughout the West Coast, this strain’s exact genetic makeup is unknown. Some sources describe it as a cross between OG Kush and an unknown second parent. On the other hand, California-based Midnight Farms sells clones of a Diamond OG that they bill as a distinct phenotype of OG Kush. Whatever its parentage, there’s no denying this strain’s potency -- its THC levels have been measured at between 13% and 22%.Diamond OG boasts impressively large flowers. These stubby, bullet-shaped nugs adhere in a dense, solid bud structure that is typically associated with indicas. Leaves are a dark shade of olive green and are threaded through with yellow to orange pistils. A thick layer of resinous trichomes glitters on the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers and makes them particularly sticky.The woodsy scent of pine and cedar wafts up from cured buds of Diamond OG. This dank aroma also has a citrus undertone, not often seen in OG varieties. Grinding up these sticky nugs releases a spicy, hashy scent, likely the influence of Afghani landrace genetics in the strain’s background. Although it may be harsh and cough-inducing to inhale, a refreshing taste of citrus comes through on the exhale. Smokers should keep in mind that this can be a particularly pungent smoke; those looking to maintain discretion should take any necessary precautions.Diamond OG offers what might only be described as a creeper of a high, often taking several minutes after users have savored its taste before its effects can be detected. A feeling of heaviness falls on the brow and eyelids; some may even feel dizzy or lightheaded. Relaxation spreads quickly, and smokers may head for refuge on the closest comfortable couch. Some mental effects are also present, but rather than cerebral or thoughtful, users are likely to feel elevated and euphoric. This sublime balance between body and head high can be an excellent way to unwind and allow the stresses and annoyances of the day to melt away. As time passes or as consumption is increased, smokers are increasingly likely to become couchlocked and dopey. In fact, at higher doses, smokers should expect to be incapacitated and shouldn’t plan on productivity. Because of its sleepy vibes, Diamond OG is better suited to nighttime than to daytime use. Its stoney effects are said to be long-lasting and potent, even for experienced cannabis users.This knockout strain’s sedative properties can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its almost narcotic relaxation can be effective at soothing pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Diamond OG may also have anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for relieving everyday annoyances like headaches or nausea. This bud’s mood-enhancing properties can even temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it does not often bring about a disorienting feeling of “mindrace,” Diamond OG is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Although seeds of Diamond OG do not seem to be widely available for sale online, companies like Midnight Farms sell clippings from mature, healthy plants that can be grown as “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid climates with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These characteristically indica plants tend to grow short and bushy and can be easily accommodated indoors. Diamond OG flowers within 9 to 10 weeks and offers an average yield of flowers. Finally, as much as this strain is a pungent smoke, it is known to be a very pungent grow; those who would like to keep their growing operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.While it may not last forever like real diamonds, a stash of Diamond OG is sure to become your new go-to indica. With strong, long-lasting effects and a rich, incense-like aroma to boot, this strain is as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared with friends.\n"

Like its namesake, Frankenstein is a mysterious patchwork of genetics, rumored to be crossed from Maui Waui and what’s thought to be an indica native to the Pacific Northwest; still other sources report that this bud is descended from OG Kush. Whatever its background, this potent bud was clearly created by a group of mad scientists -- cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured its psychoactivity at between 13% and a staggering 29%.Frankenstein is marked by medium-sized flowers that hold a spade-like shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Buds cling together in a dense, solid structure, as is characteristic of indicas. The leaves are a mossy shade of green and are twisted through with curly, rust-colored hairs -- which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. A high volume of trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these buds, accounting for their psychoactivity and making them very difficult to break up without the use of a grinder.When properly cured, Frankenstein’s flowers burst with a strong skunky pungency, accented by some notes of fresh pine. On closer inspection, there is also some citrus hiding underneath the skunky dankness. Meanwhile, grinding or breaking open these dense buds yields some spicy, hashy, odors, lending credence to the idea that Frankenstein is descended from OG Kush. When combusted, Frankenstein burns with a heavy, cough-inducing smoke that tastes lemony and slightly tropical on the exhale.Frankenstein’s high hits quickly for an indica. Almost immediately, smokers detect a heavy feeling of relaxation falling on the eyelids and limbs. Deep breathing may happen more easily as muscular tension begins to evaporate. Rather than bringing about intense cerebral effects, this bud confers a cloudy mental state. Some sensory warping like auditory or visual distortions may lead to a slightly trippy mindset and facilitate creative brainstorming or daydreaming. This hazy feeling is just the thing for distracting users from any lingering stresses of the outside world. Nevertheless, Frankenstein allows smokers to maintain some mental agility and leaves them fully capable of carrying on conversations or interacting with one another. This makes it a good choice for social settings, where its giddy energy may result in fits of giggling. As the high wears on, users may find themselves walking as stiffly or uneasily as Frankenstein himself. In high enough doses, this strain can lull smokers into a deep, restful sleep. Because of these sedative properties, the strain is better suited to nighttime than to daytime enjoyment.Frankenstein may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its deep and thorough relaxation can relieve aches and pains, whether they’re temporary and injury-related or chronic, due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory effects may soothe more common irritations like headaches or indigestion. Psychologically speaking, the bud’s mood-altering effects can provide temporary improvement in the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Finally, as noted, Frankenstein can be an antidote to even stubborn cases of insomnia. Because it is unlikely to trigger intense, paranoid, this strain is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial breeders have claimed responsibility for this pungent strain, and none have made its seeds available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of Frankenstein from a trusted source in order to grow “clones” of this monster. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Frankenstein is known to offer a lower than average yield of flowers come harvest time.With roots in the Pacific Northwest, Frankenstein is most likely to be found in Washington state and Oregon dispensaries. This mellow strain is great for solo unwinding; it’s also enjoyable with friends -- but don’t share it with anyone who’d be quick to point out that the green-faced, bolt-necked literary creature is actually called Frankenstein’s Monster.\n"

        "description": "Euphoria (not to be confused with the similarly-named Euforia) is a well-balanced indica hybrid that offers a deep, therapeutic relaxation thanks to higher than average quantities of the cannabinoid CBD. Created by the Amsterdam-based Royal Queen Seeds, it is a cross between CBD-rich Royal Medic and award-winning Shark Shock. While this strain’s THC content is only about 6%, CBD levels as high as 7% more than compensate for this loss in psychoactivity.When properly trimmed, Euphoria offers long, almost cylindrical flowers. These buds cling together in a dense, solid indica formation. Leaves are vibrant shade of kelly green and are shot through with brown and yellow pistils. Because of lower THC levels, Euphoria contains fewer trichomes than other indica-dominant strains. These flowers burst with a sweet and fruity flavor profile. When combusted, they burn with a smooth, easy smoke and taste more deeply fruity on the exhale.CBD plays a large role in this strain’s appeal. Smokers are more likely to feel a gradual onset of effects, and may eventually notice a reduction in muscular tension and an increased capacity for deep breathing. All the while, mental faculties are undiminished and users will find that they’re unusually lucid, able to execute complex tasks or carry on long conversations. Medically, such sedative properties can be useful for reducing chronic aches and pains, and, in large enough doses, relieving insomnia. Euphoria’s effects may also be psychologically useful in temporarily relieving the difficulties caused by social anxiety.Seeds of Euphoria are available from Royal Queens Seeds. Once obtained, the strain can be grow indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branching, and are easily accommodated indoors. Euphoria flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest by early October when grown outdoors. For their efforts, it offers growers a yield of about 42 to 46 grams (or 1.4 - 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.\n"

        "description": "Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has inspired the names of cannabis strains Willy Wonka and Golden Ticket. Now Gobstopper joins the fanciful bunch. This well-balanced hybrid was created by Extreme Boutique Genetics, the Northern California-based breeders who have devised similarly inventive strains. Gobstopper is a cross between Extreme’s own Candied Diesel and sativa favorite Vortex. The result is a soothing blend of physical and cerebral effects, accented by a multilayered, sour-fruity flavor. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s THC content at between 13% and 21%.The bag appeal of Gobstopper’s flowers is evident right away. They set themselves apart with an irregular shape and large, chunky buds that adhere in the dense structure typically associated with indicas. The curling leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are shot through with vibrant orange pistils. Some phenotypes of this bud also show off shades of purple; these hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genes are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, the already-colorful flowers are covered in translucent white trichomes that give them an icy, shiny appearance.The fictional “everlasting” candies after which this strain is named are famous for gradually revealing different layers of flavor; Gobstopper’s complex aroma follows suit. The primary aroma of these flowers is citrus -- particularly, grapefruit. Closer inspection yields hints of berries and uber-sweet cotton candy. Despite its mostly sweet character, when combusted, this bud can give off a harsh, eye-stinging smoke. The smoke tastes like diesel on the exhale, with some lingering citric, acidic punch. Notably, despite its purple coloring, grape is one flavor that Gobstopper lacks; this is because the pigments that produce its occasional violet hues do not have a corresponding effect on the strain’s taste.Gobstopper’s high hits quickly, exerting a pressure around the eyes and forehead. The ensuing effects could be described as mind-expanding -- smokers may feel more creative or may be more open to suggestion from others or from external stimuli. Some smokers may also detect some altered perception, and visual and auditory distortions are commonly reported. Rather than disorientation, though, Gobstopper’s high approaches euphoria; Extreme Boutique Genetics themselves have likened its uplifting effects to the elation that a child feels on Christmas morning. Much like it multilayered flavor profile, Gobstopper also has a multifaceted high. As time wears on or as dosage is increased, a strong, pervasive sense of physical relaxation sets in, setting the stage for users to mellow out with friends or to wind down alone. Although it’s unlikely to cause couchlock, the mental fog that creeps through on Gobstopper’s backend will probably render most smokers unable to complete any complex tasks. Because of its taper down from energetic stimulation to relaxation, Gobstopper is recommended for afternoon or evening use.Gobstopper may also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its easygoing character can temporarily dull the symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, it may also relieve deep-seated aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. Anti-inflammatory effects can take care of lesser afflictions like headaches or nausea. Because its onset is associated with cerebral stimulation and potential mindrace, Gobstopper should be consumed with caution by patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Extreme Boutique Genetics has not made seeds of Gobstopper available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of the strain from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This hybrid can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out the flowers’ purple streaks should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least 10 to 15 degrees below average, just before flowering begins. Gobstopper flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and rewards patient growers with a higher than average yield.Why settle for only two or three flavors in your small-batch strain? A true winner of a hybrid, Gobstopper offers several unique flavors and a therapeutic high to boot.\n"

        "description": "Red Cherry Berry is an extra-fruity treat with balanced effects and beautiful, multicolored flowers. This hybrid is the brainchild of prolific California-based Barney’s Farm, the creators of Vanilla Kush and Liberty Haze. it is a cross between notoriously pungent Skunk #1 and a North American landrace indica. With moderate levels of CBD, this tasty strain is therapeutic as well as recreationally rewarding. Its THC content ranges from 14% to 22%.\n\nVisually, Red Cherry Berry is a true stunner with jumbo flowers that maintain a solid, almost totally spherical formation. These buds have a typically indica structure, with a compact core and small leaves that coil tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are twisted through with a higher than average number of hairy red and orange pistils. Some phenotypes of the strain also show off traces of lavender, thanks to a combination of cold ambient weather during the growing process and pigments called anthocyanins. Finally, a dusting of white trichomes makes these nuggets extra sticky and ensures their potency.\n\nWhen properly cured, Red Cherry Berry’s powerful berry aroma floats right to the top, giving off a sweet and slightly tart scent. There’s also a dank, earthy odor lurking underneath, similar to damp soil or a musty basement. Grinding up these buds, meanwhile, yields some of the rich funk of parent strain Skunk. Despite some acrid flavors, Red Cherry Berry gives off a smooth smoke when burnt. This easily palatable smoke carries a sweet and refreshing berry flavor on the exhale.\n\nRed Cherry Berry hits right away with both barrels. At first, smokers may notice a heightened blood pressure in the face, as well as an increase in salivation. Soon after, they may feel waves of relaxation rolling down through their core and radiating out through their limbs. Although this strain is incredibly relaxing from the outset, it’s also mentally stimulating. At the same time as they start to seek out a comfortable seat, users also experience an uptick in theri cerebral thinking patterns. Thoughts can take on an intensified quality and any rambling inner monologues may seem to become progressively louder. While this can be a good way for the busy consumer to accomplish detail-oriented work, it’s also useful for sparking conversation and easy camaraderie in social situations. Red Cherry Berry is unique in that its powerful body high comes alongside definite mental lucidity from the outset. In that sense, it’s great even for less traditionally productive purposes; for example, its relaxing and thoughtful energy is a good way to enjoy some introspective solo time. As time passes, this bud’s sense of body melt tends to intensify and could derail any plans for getting out the door to exercise or to run some errands. In these later stages, enjoy the strain’s psychedelic sensations and trick your perception (particularly, your sense of time) with moody atmospheric enhancements like music or visually-engaging movies. With increased dosage, expect some serious couchlock. Although it allows for concentration throughout the duration of its buzz, Red Cherry Berry’s extended sedation means that it’s probably best enjoyed later in the day when its laid back vibe can be fully appreciated.\n\nRed Cherry Berry’s versatility also gives it a few applications for medical cannabis patients. It may be a boon to those with attention deficit disorder, helping them to sustain focus and concentration. Its upbeat mood may also temporarily improve cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. On the physical side of the spectrum, it may dull aches and pains, whether they’re chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia, or minor, like headaches and nausea. Because its long-lasting body high tends to even out its mental stimulation, Red Cherry Berry is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.\n\nSeeds of this fruity strain are available directly through Barney’s Farm. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with hot and sunny daytime conditions. Plants tend to be short and bushy, rarely exceeding 3 feet in height. Red Cherry Berry flowers within a quick 7 to 8 weeks and provides a solid yield of about 37 to 46 grams (or 1.3 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nThis therapeutic strain is an excellent way to decompress, whether you’re enjoying it alone or in the company of good friends. It you break it out in a party setting, be ready for its crowd-pleasing aroma to turn some heads.\n\n"

        "description": "Herojuana (sometimes spelled Herijuana) is a mostly indica hybrid that delivers knockout physical sedation. It is crafted from two specialty strains: Petrolia Headstash, an Afghani-descended indica originally bred in Humboldt County, California, and a mysterious strain from Kentucky known simply as Killer New Haven. Originally created by Woodhorse Seeds, the breeders responsible for medical-grade strains like BC Chemo and Orange Chemo, Herojuana is a must-try for fans of heavy indicas. This strain’s THC has been measured at between 12% and a whopping 30%, making it certain to impress even veteran cannabis users.Herojuana is marked by large, long flowers that taper down from a broad base into a fine-pointed tip. These visually-impressive buds have a characteristically indica structure, densely and solidly packed. Leaves are a mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Phenotypes of this strain also frequently boast shades of purple, ranging from lavender to deep violet -- these colors come about when anthocyanin pigments are excited by colder than average weather during the growing process. A layer of trichomes covers the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces, making them particularly hard to break up without the use of a quality grinder.Properly cured, Herojuana flowers have an unmitigated skunky funk, accented by only slight hints of fruit. Lying underneath are basenotes of hash and incense, while breaking open or grinding the bud yields some spice and sandalwood. When combusted, Herojuana burns with a harsh smoke that may sting the palate, triggering coughing or watery eyes. This thick smoke has a simultaneously fruity and spicy taste on the exhale, like an orange studded with cloves. Those smoking in public should beware that this is a very pungent strain; precautions should be taken in order to ensure discretion.This strain offers what is best described as a creeper of a high: several minutes after enjoying Herojuana, smokers will feel a tingle of relaxation that spreads down from the neck through the core and limbs in gradually increasing waves. This relaxation, bordering on total numbness, becomes more and more thorough as the high wears on. As such, anyone enjoying this bud should not plan on having a busy and productive high. Herojuana offers little to no mental stimulation -- on the contrary, smokers are likely to become cloudy and dopey, albeit totally content. Instead, this strain is great for zoning out after a long day and listening to some slow, atmospheric music. If you do have to move after smoking Herojuana, prepare for the bizarre sensation of wading through peanut butter. As dosage is increased, users are even more likely to become incapacitated and horizontal. Eventually, this sedation beckons smokers to sleep with its smooth soothing body high. Clearly, Herojuana is better suited to mellow nighttime than to morning or afternoon use.Herojuana’s thick, almost narcotic effects can also have many applications for medical cannabis patients. It’s near-miracle for pain relief, working to relieve both temporary and chronic aches and pains. Anti-inflammatory properties may take care of more minor irritations like headaches and indigestion. Furthermore, this strain can provoke acute hunger, making it a great supplement for patients who have lost their hunger to harsh medications or treatments like chemotherapy. As noted, Herojuana can also be an antidote to insomnia. Because it isn’t likely to bring about paranoid patterns of thinking, the strain is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or anxiety.Fortunately, several companies have made seeds of Herojuana available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those looking to bring out the bud’s full purple bag appeal should briefly expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Herojuana flowers within 7 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers as much as 46 grams (or 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot. Finally, as much as this bud is pungent when burnt, it’s just as stinky when growing; those looking to keep their indoor grow operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Herojuana has made a name for itself in the pantheon of potent indicas. It’s even yielded the potent derivative Orange Herijuana, bred from Orange Creamsicle. As enjoyable solo as it is when shared with friends, this hybrid is a sure path to heavy sedation.\n"

        "description": "Nikola Tesla was a pioneering scientist whose study of electricity and alternating currents laid the groundwork for the modern concept of renewable energy. Sativa-dominant hybrid Tesla Tower (named after the scientist’s early radio transmission station on Long Island) is as inspiring as Tesla himself. This electrifying strain was bred by Lazy Bee Genetics, Washington state growers who maintain an ecologically-sustainable approach to cannabis cultivation. Tesla Tower is a cross between Lazy Bee’s own Wifi (aka White Fire OG) and trichome-covered Snowcap. This bud was potent enough to earn recognition from Dope Magazine, having been named the publication’s 2017 runner-up for Best Sativa. Tesla Tower’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 13% and 22% THC.Despite mostly sativa genetics, Tesla Tower has tight and solid indica-like buds, marked by an almost spherical shape. Its leaves are a mossy green and are threaded through with curly orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). These buds are also coated in silvery trichomes that almost obscure the flowers’ natural coloring.Lazy Bee has a stated commitment to cultivating complex terpene profiles in their flagship strains, and it shows in Tesla Tower. When properly cured, the flowers have a woodsy, piney scent with some dank, kushy aroma underneath. Grinding up or breaking open the buds offers some sour citrus notes as well. When combusted, Tesla Tower burns with a smoke that is thick and rich, but surprisingly smooth on the lungs. This aromatic smoke has a distinct floral taste on the exhale.Tesla Tower’s buzzy high takes hold almost immediately -- smokers may notice a constriction of blood vessels around the eyes and temples before they’ve even finished exhaling this strain’s flavorful smoke. This physical twinge is soon matched by a burst of energy that can provide the motivation necessary for pursuits like exercising or tackling a pile of work. Tesla Tower may also enhance more mundane chores like cleaning the house. After some time, many smokers report a strong uptick in freely-associative, rapid-fire thought patterns. This cerebral ethos may be overwhelming for some; in the right set and setting, though, it can be a great aid for brainstorming or for working through a complex problem-solving scenario. Tesla Tower comes with little to no physical effects and certainly none of the incapacitating couchlock that comes with more indica-influenced strains. Because of the heights of its euphoric and stimulating beginnings, this high may cause some users to “crash” with drowsiness when it ends. Nevertheless, this energetic bud is a great daytime smoke and is particularly well-suited to waking-and-baking.Tesla Tower may also have practical applications for medical cannabis patients. Its head-focused effects may allow those with attention deficit disorders to maintain long-lasting focus on single tasks. Its mood-elevating qualities can also help those suffering from stress and depression to spend their time more consciously and mindfully than they otherwise might. Anti-inflammatory properties can alleviate everyday irritations like headaches or nausea. Because of the potentially disorienting mindrace associated with its onset, Tesla Tower is not a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Lazy Bee Genetics has not made seeds of Tesla Tower available for sale online; as such, those looking to grow the strain at home must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best practices for cultivation of this specific strain, we know that, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or out (although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate with consistent daylight)A must-try for sativa lovers, Tesla Tower is an ideal for everything from finding the motivation to exercise to stumbling across the creative inspiration needed to work on a personal project. It is somewhat difficult to come by outside of the Pacific Northwest and should be snatched up if ever spotted on dispensary shelves.\n"

        "description": "Fruit Punch is a predominantly sativa hybrid with a uniquely fruity flavor profile that might remind you of the sugary soft drinks of your youth. It was created by European company Heavyweight Seeds, the same people who have given us taste-focused strains like Lemon Cake and Green Ninja. Genetically, Fruit Punch offers something for everyone -- it is a cross between Haze, Skunk #1, and Northern Lights. These three powerhouse strains combine to yield a bold, long-lasting bud with strong cerebral effects. The hybrid’s potency has been measured at between 17% and 25% THC. Fruit Punch’s bag appeal is clear from the outset: its large flowers have a distinctly bullet-like shape. Despite being mostly sativa, these buds hold the dense, solid structure more commonly associated with indicas. The tightly-curling leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are shot through with brown and orange pistils. In some phenotypes of the strain, leaves and even stems also show faint hints of purple; these surprising hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plants’ genetics are excited by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a coating of milky-white trichomes gives these already-colorful flowers an icy sheen and accounts for their psychoactivity.A fruity berry scent wafts up from the cured buds. Although sweet, the impression is more sugary than naturally fruity, somewhat reminiscent of candy or sherbert. Lurking underneath is a slightly piney and dank aroma. When combusted, Fruit Punch burns with a smooth smoke that’s very easy on the lungs; this smoke tastes herbal and floral on the exhale, courtesy of parent strain Haze.Fruit Punch has a high that hits relatively quickly, bestowing a pressure that can be felt around the cheeks, eyes, and temples. As smokers adjust to this novel physical sensation, they find themselves launched into a buzzy, head-focused high. This fast-paced energy can be a great motivational tool for anything that’s on your agenda, be it complex, analytical work, innovative, creative crafts or projects, or simply mundane tasks like house cleaning. While Fruit Punch allows users to maintain lucidity and concentration, it may also have certain trippy effects -- chiefly, a strong sense of time dilation. In social settings, this cerebral energy can also yield a remarkably warm and giddy feeling. After some time, a sense of physical relaxation emerges to even out this stain’s head buzz. Nevertheless, thoughts may continue to flow; although users may be less likely to be out and about as this high wears on, they may remain mentally stimulated. The combination of mental and physical effects makes Fruit Punch a great way to enhance activities that involve both brain and body, like exercise, dancing, and not least of all, sex. Although a great wake-and-bake strain, Fruit Punch is also enjoyable during the afternoon and early evening; at night, it may keep smokers overly alert.Medical cannabis patients may find derive many psychological benefits from this mentally-focused strain. Its long-lasting focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on a single task. It may also temporarily relieve the difficult symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically, Fruit Punch may soothe users’ aches and pains as well. Because its onset may come with the kind of “mindrace” that may lead to intense, recursive thinking, this strain is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Conveniently, Heavyweight has made seeds of Fruit Punch available for sale online. A sturdy and resilient grow, it is a good choice for newcomers to cultivation. The hybrid can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Like many sativas, Fruit Punch can grow very tall and may require some early training and trimming when grown indoors. Those looking to bring out the bud’s purple potential should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least 10 to 15 degrees below average. Fruit Punch flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. It offers a high yield of about 57 grams (or 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.A great party bud, Fruit Punch can bring about a positive, energetic mood when shared with like-minded friends. Just be sure to bring enough to share, as this strain’s fruity aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Incredible Hulk is a sativa-dominant hybrid that offers head-focused effects and a pleasant, citrusy flavor profile. This strain combines the best of its two popular parent strains: Green Crack and Jack Herer, both flavorful, sativa-leaning varieties themselves. With its clear bag appeal and buzzy, long-lasting effects, this bud proves that the Marvel’s Hulk isn’t the only green monster in town. Incredible Hulk’s THC levels have been reported at between 15% and 24%.Incredible Hulk sets itself apart with large, chunky flowers that bulge like Bruce Banner’s green muscles. The buds are almost spherical in shape and hold together in a relatively loose, spindly structure; leaves are fluffy and can be easily torn away from their central stems. The mossy green leaves are set off by a high volume of bright orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, translucent, amber-colored trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of the flowers, giving them a slightly yellow sheen and accounting for their psychoactivity.When properly cured, flowers of Incredible Hulk primarily smell like an earthy combination of citrus and pine. This aromatic blend has the same clean, hoppy character that’s so central to parent strain Jack Herer’s herbal, Haze-inflected appeal. On closer inspection, there are also some fruity notes of berry, albeit with a slightly spoiled, fermented edge. When combusted, Incredible Hulk burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke that tastes both tropical and piney on the exhale.Incredible Hulk’s high hits quickly, smacking users with a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples. These physical sensations are soon eclipsed by a buzzy feeling of mental stimulation. Users may feel their thoughts flowing in rapid association. In the right set and setting, this cerebral high can lead to euphoria, helping smokers to find fascination in any external stimuli. Such an intense, attentive mindset easily lends itself to accomplishing work -- whether it’s free-flowing and creative or rigorous and analytical. The strain may also provide the physical motivation needed to exercise with the vigor of the Hulk himself. As the high wears on, users may feel some slight physical stimulation, ranging from increased tactile sensitivity to thorough relaxation; this simultaneous action on mind and body can make Incredible Hulk a potent aphrodisiac under the right conditions. Some fans of the strain report a powerful sense of time dilation, in which they can become lost in rabbit holes of their own thoughts. This trippy edge makes the bud a great accompaniment to stimulating conversations and compelling movies. A quintessential wake-and-bake strain, Incredible Hulk is not appropriate for use before bed, as it’s likely to leave smokers wired and alert.Incredible Hulk’s mental effects can have some psychological benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to encourage deep, lasting focus makes it a useful tool for those with attention deficit disorders. Furthermore, the strain’s ability to elevate mood can be an effective way to temporarily dull the symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. To a lesser degree, physiological effects come in the form of anti-inflammatory protection from irritations like headaches and nausea. Because the early phase of its high is associated with “mindrace” and possible paranoia, Incredible Hulk is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Although no commercial-grade breeders have made seeds of Incredible Hulk available for sale online, prospective growers can obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain (either online or from other trusted growers) in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This hybrid can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Incredible Hulk’s mostly sativa genetics mean than its plants are likely to grow tall -- if cultivated indoors, they’ll need to be trained and trimmed early on in order to fit in limited spaces. Incredible Hulk flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers once mature.A must-try for sativa lovers, this long-lasting and energetic bud is the ideal pick-me-up for experienced and novice cannabis users alike. Rather than making consumers angry like its namesake, Incredible Hulk works to stimulate therapeutic and reflective thinking.\n"

It’s a cross between the infamous Chronic and the speciality, landrace-derived strain Ed Rosenthal Super Bud. King Kong was created by Spanish breeder Dr. Underground, who has also crafted boutique strains like Painkiller and Brooklyn Mango -- the latter of which also has Ed Rosenthal Super Bud as a parent. King Kong’s potency has been measured at between 14% and 21% THC.King Kong impresses with large flowers that adhere in a distinct cone shape. These nuggets hold the dense and solid structure that you’d expect to see in a predominantly indica varietal. Most notable about these flowers is their color contrast: the leaves are a dark shade of forest green, while the hairy pistils stand out in bright orange. Cloudy white trichomes dot the already-colorful buds, accounting for their psychoactivity and giving them a very sticky texture.When properly cured, King Kong has a dank, earthy odor with unmistakable highlights of skunk. Hanging out underneath is a fruity tang that keeps the strain from smelling too acrid. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers reveals a surprising floral scent. When combusted, King Kong burns with a smooth and palatable smoke that tastes sweet and sour on the exhale. Those enjoying this strain in public should take precautions, as it can be a particularly pungent and indiscreet smoke.King Kong hits relatively quickly for an indica. Before the strain’s skunky taste has left their mouths, users feel a weightiness in their limbs and eyelids. Rather than mounting progressively over time, the body high sets in quickly. Mental effects arrive in the form of sensory enhancement -- smokers may notice that external stimuli take on new dimensions and seem more interesting than they ordinarily might. Visual and auditory distortions are commonly reported. In the right set and setting, this psychedelic tone can inspire creativity and introspection. While King Kong doesn’t knock its users out with full-on couchlock, over time, it eases all tension that may be held in the body. The subsequent state of anxiety-free relaxation can be pointed in whatever direction the user prefers -- be it productivity or contended laziness. In high enough doses, however, King Kong can lead to intractable couchlock and sleep. Because of its sedative tendences, this bud is best suited to evening and nighttime use. Its effects are said to last longer than average, even for experienced cannabis users.King Kong can also have several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its deep and thorough physical relaxation is an efficient analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may relieve more common annoyances like headaches or indigestion. As noted, King Kong may lull even insomniacs into a fulfilling sleep. Psychologically speaking, King Kong may temporarily take the edge off of the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it does not often lead to the kind of intense, recursive thinking patterns associated with paranoia, King Kong is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Dr. Underground has made seeds of King Kong available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or outdoors; while outdoor cultivation typically requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate, the strong landrace genes in parent strain Ed Rosenthal’s background may make King Kong a hardier and more resilient grow than many others. King Kong flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for outdoor harvest between late September and early October. It offers conscientious growers a high yield of bud for their efforts. Finally, just as this strain is a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow; those looking to keep their indoor grow rooms under the radar should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters.Pair this powerful indica with fellow indica hybrid Godzilla for a true battle of the fictional titans -- one that’ll likely result in you glued to your couch for much of the immediate future.\n"

        "description": "Ether -- also known as the “Ether” cut of Alien Dawg -- is an indica-dominant hybrid with potent effects. This distinct phenotype of Alien Dawg was selectively bred by Cali Connection (also the purveyors of Deadhead OG) and has intensely sedative effects. Ether is also known for its incredible pungent aroma. Possibly named for the 19th-century nickname for nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, Ether has a THC content of between 14% and 21%.Ether is marked by impressively large and solid flowers. The buds tend to be shaped like miniature pinecones, tapering down from a broad base to a sharply pointed tip. The curly, overlapping leaves maintain the densely-packed structure often associated with other indica-leaning strains. Ether’s leaves appear to be yellowish-green and are twisted through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. Finally, a blanket of sticky trichomes makes these big buds difficult to break up without the aid of a quality grinder.When properly cured, Ether’s flowers give off a fruity berry scent. On closer inspection, there is also a tangy and sour aroma at play, possibly passed on from the Chemdawg in the bud’s background. Grinding up these flowers gives off some notes of pine that are passed on from parent strain Alien Tech. When it is burnt, Ether can give off a very thick and acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and sinuses. On the exhale, this harsh smoke tastes like sour pine. Smokers who want to maintain discretion may want to take some precautions, as these buds can be very pungent.Ether’s high is a creeper that may take as many as 15 minutes after users have finished coughing on its thick smoke before revealing its effects. At first, Ether makes its presence known with heady sensations like a flushing in the cheeks or an increase in salivation. Soon afterward, the strain begins to work on its consumers’ cognition. It may make for some changes in sensory perception, including an intensification of certain external stimuli or an uncanny feeling of time dilation. It’s up to the smoker to choose how to enjoy these early psychedelic vibes -- reading or watching a movie can inspire some bouts of deep, reflective thinking, while putting on a moody album may create some intense, mind-bending ambiance. In any case, Ether’s high eventually becomes hazy and dreamy. Sustained concentration may be difficult, and work on complicated, analytical tasks may be totally impossible. Instead, consumers ought to kick back and enjoy the pervasive body high that emerges on Ether’s backend. It’s not unheard of for the already-relaxed smoker to totally sink into their surroundings and lose track of time or their train of thought. At this point, Ether may also relieve any lingering muscular tension or may facilitate deep, restorative breathing. In the right set and setting, the strain can even lull users into a fulfilling sleep. Because it is mostly lazy and relaxing, Ether is recommended for evening or nighttime enjoyment.Ether’s strong, almost narcotic sedation can have benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It's easy going energy make temporarily relieve the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also soothe physical pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. As noted, Ether can even work against insomnia, granting deep and therapeutic sleep. Because it is not known to bring about the sort of deep, analytical thinking that comes with more sativa-inflected strains, Ether is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Unfortunately for home growers, seeds of Ether are not available for sale online. Instead, those looking to cultivate the strain should obtain clippings of mature plants that can be grown as genetically identical “clones.” While there’s little info available on specific best practices for growing Ether, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a hot and humid climate. We also know that its indica roots suggest short, bushy crops that may require occasional pruning. Feelings of disorienting “mindrace” are rarely reported with Ether -- nevertheless, consumers who are prone to panic should consume this potent but with some caution and moderation.Ether is a must-try for diehard fans of indicas. While its flavor may be divisive, its soothing, mellow effects are indisputable.\n"

        "description": "Orange Creamiscle is a sativa-dominant hybrid with balance, subtle effects. The real highlight here is the boutique strain’s memorable flavor profile, a combination of sweet citrus and vanilla that reminds many of the classic dessert of the same name. A cross between Orange Crush and Juicy Fruit, both flavor-engineered strains themselves, Orange Creamsicle was created by MTG Seeds, breeders who supply California dispensaries with various limited edition strains. With somewhat lower than average potency, this strain may be a good choice for newcomers to cannabis; its psychoactivity has been measured at between 7% and 18% THC.Orange Creamsicle stands out with large, solid flowers that are almost cylindrical in shape, tapering slightly from base to tip. The densely-packed leaves are a mossy shade of green. Bright orange pistils stand out vibrantly against the leaves while plenty of translucent white trichomes give the flowers a silvery sheen. This coexistence of orange pistils and white trichomes within these buds seems to suggest that the flowers’ color scheme is more of a reason for this strain’s name than its actual flavor.Properly cured, flowers of Orange Creamsicle emit a sharp citrus tang. Hanging out underneath is a fruity berry scent, possibly passed on from grandparent strain Blueberry. These flowers have a relative lack of dank or spicy odors, even when ground up or broken open. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, Orange Creamsicle gives off a smooth and easy smoke. There’s an undeniable aftertaste of orange on the exhale; some smokers also report hints of vanilla hanging out on the palate.For a sativa, Orange Creamsicle offers a relatively slow, creeping high. Several minutes after savoring this bud’s unique taste, smokers will feel a constriction of blood vessels around the eyes and temples. Eventually, smokers also notice an uptick in freely-associative thought. Far from intensely cerebral, though, these mental effects are subtle. Users are typically still able to converse or to carry on with any complicated analytical or creative tasks in front of them. As the high wears on, a gradual feeling of physical relaxation creeps in, banishing muscular tension and allowing consumers to breathe more deeply and easily. This combination of mental and physical effects can take the edge off of a long day, eliminating stressors and allowing for some mellow introspective time. Relaxing but not sleepy, Orange Creamsicle rarely leads to couchlock. It is also free from the sharp, disorienting comedown from euphoria that may come with some purer sativas. Because of its versatile and even-handed effects, this bud is as enjoyable for a wake-and-bake as it is for a nighttime treat.Orange Creamsicle may have several benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its ability to regulate mood can temporarily alleviate the acute symptoms of mild to moderate stress, depression, and anxiety. The strain’s relaxing somatic effects can also soothe patients’ aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Additionally, anti-inflammatory properties may take care of more common irritations like headaches or nausea. Because of its lack of intense cerebral effects, Orange Creamsicle is a good option for those who may be prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Orange Creamsicle are sometimes available from breeder MTG, pending stock levels. Alternatively, prospective growers can obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clone.” This bud can be grown indoors, or outdoors in semi-humid climates with consistent daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. That said, Orange Creamsicle can be a hardy, resilient grow even in adverse conditions, thanks to the sturdy Thai and Afghani landrace genes in parent strain Juicy Fruit’s background. Like many sativas, these plants can reach great heights and, if grown indoors, will need to be trained early on in the vegetative stage through regular trimming and pruning. Also like many sativas, Orange Creamsicle has a long flowering time of about 9 weeks when cultivated indoors. It is known to offer growers a high yield of flowers for their efforts.Orange Creamsicle’s refreshing flavor and middle-of-the-road high are as enjoyable when savored alone as they are when shared with friends. If you do decided to share this bud, make sure you have enough, as its crowd-pleasing aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Critical Kush is an indica strain that delivers powerful, full-body relaxation and soothing mental effects. It is the brainchild of Barney’s Farm, the California-based growers who have given us such powerful strains as LSD and Liberty Haze. Critical Kush is a cross between Afghani-descended Critical Mass and none other than OG Kush. Cannabis testing lab gives this bud consistently high marks, with THC measurements between 16% and a whopping 29%. With that kind of potency, Critical Kush is almost certain to put you in critical condition.Critical Kush sets itself apart with medium to large-sized nugs of resin-filled goodness. The buds are densely-packed, as you might expect of a pure indica. Leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with deep orange pistils. A network of shiny trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these large buds, making them very difficult to break up without the help of a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Critical Kush emit a dank, earthy odor. There are some hints of citrus to brighten things up -- an aroma that becomes even more evident when grinding this bud -- but overall, the impression is dank and kushy. When combusted, Critical Kush may burn with a harsh and acrid smoke that can sting the eyes and sinuses. On the exhale, this thick smoke tastes like pine with a slight spicy kick. Finally, Critical Kush can be a very pungent smoke, and those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.Since Critical Kush offers a true creeper of a high, smokers should wait a while after their first toke before boosting dosage. As much as 15 minutes after sampling this strain, users begin to feel a tingle of relaxation spread through the limbs and core. Smokers also report a decreased heart rate and a lessening of muscular tension. Although mental effects are subtle, Critical Kush does have some effect on the senses, with many reporting visual or auditory distortion. Other than that, smokers shouldn’t expect an intense cerebral experience; on the contrary, this bud is more likely to leave users contentedly dopey. It’s a good choice for an evening indoors, spent working on mindless tasks like cleaning. If you’re riding a more sleepy vibe, it’s also a great option for binge-watching or for zoning out to some soothing music. Although Critical Kush can be fun in social situations, note that it can trigger couchlock in higher doses, and may make you less willing to actively engage with company. It should go without saying that, because of its heavily sedative effects, Critical Kush is better suited to evening than to daytime use.Medical cannabis patients can also find various uses in this strain’s therapeutic properties. It can work against deep-seated aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. The medicine’s anti-inflammatory may also help with more minor irritations like headaches or nausea. This strain’s mood-elevating effects may provide some welcome (albeit temporary) relief from stress, depression, and even anxiety. Finally, in high enough doses, Critical Kush may lull even insomniacs into a deep, fulfilling sleep. Because paranoid, cerebral thinking isn’t common with this strain, it’s a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Both Barney’s Farm and Dutch company Royal Queen Seeds have made seeds of Critical Kush available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Critical Kush flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors. Grown properly, it can offer as much as 56 grams (about 2 ounces) or flower per square foot of plant! Note that, just as this is a pungent smoke, it can be a very stinky grow (after all, parent strain Critical Mass has Skunk in its genes!) and indoor growers may want to invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.While it’s great for a night at home, Critical Kush’s dank and piney aroma is also a great way to enhance your enjoyment of the great outdoors -- trying bringing it along on your next camping trip.\n"

        "description": "Crown OG is a pure indica that enjoys the benefits of some prestigious genetics. Although its creators are as yet unidentified, this strain is said to be descended from the king of all pungent indicas, OG Kush. Offering a deep, therapeutic body high, it’s no wonder that a sugar wax made from Crown OG by Greenwolf La and Nature’s Lab Extracts won the title of Best Indica Concentrate in the 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup held in Denver. This bud’s potency has been measured at between 23% and 28%.Flowers of Crown OG are only small to medium in size, but cling together in dense buds that resist users’ attempts to break them apart. The nugs are spade shaped, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. The leaves of these dense flowers are a mossy green and are wound through with curly orange hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants). A blanket of cloudy white trichomes gives this strain a silvery sheen and accounts for its psychoactivity, as well as its sticky texture.Crown OG is at once notable for its strong chemical funk -- when first inspected, the flowers give off a strong tang that smell something like ammonia or cat urine. The classic dank OG scent comes through more when users grind up their bud; grinding releases a skunky aroma as well. When burnt in a joint or pipe, Crown OG burns with a thick, acrid smoke that some may find harsh and cough-inducing. This smoke tastes piney with a rich whiff of gasoline on the exhale.Crown OG’s high creeps up slowly, sometimes taking several minutes after users have finished toking to show itself. When it does arrive, the high initially manifests as a pressure around the eyes and temples. Soon after, a weighty, stoney feeling settles over the entire body. While experienced smokers might feel soothed by this sudden sensation, it can be somewhat disorienting for those with a lower THC tolerance. Because of its sedative power, Crown OG is best suited to daydreaming or enjoying some slow, atmospheric music at home; keep snacks handy too, as the strain can be a strong appetite stimulant. Although this bud comes with some mental stimulation, it doesn’t often lead to the kind of deep, cerebral thinking that usually associated with more sativa-influenced strains. Instead, smokers report a steady feeling of euphoria that lends itself to giddiness and free-flowing conversations in social settings.Those who have been able to remain awake through the strain’s tranquilizing effects also report that it can be an effective aphrodisiac under the right circumstances. In high enough doses, couchlock and sleep can be expected with this strain. It’s more appropriate for nighttime than morning or afternoon use.Crown OG’s strong, almost narcotic effects can have benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can relieve even stubborn cases of insomnia with its sedation. It may also relieve aches and pains, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic and nerve-related, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Anti-inflammatory effects can soothe everyday irritations like headaches. While Crown OG isn’t often associated with recursive, paranoid patterns of thinking, its fast-acting body high can throw some less experienced smokers for a loop. As such, those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume with caution.No large-scale growers have made seeds of Crown OG available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available regarding best practices for cultivation of this specific strain, we know that, like many strains, it can be grown indoors, or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Additionally, because of its indica background, we know that plants of the strain grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Growers should regularly trim away any broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching flowering nodes on lower branches of the crops.Crown OG paves the way for nighttime relaxation. It’s enjoyable when shared with friends, but consume this bud solo if you want to give yourself the true royal treatment.\n"

        "description": "Dairy Queen is a hybrid that, while sativa-dominant, offers an incredibly well-balanced high that’s versatile enough to suit any mood or setting. It is the brainchild of TGA Subcool, the prolific growing collective that has also created inventive strains like Cheesequake and Pennywise. This bud is a cross between English staple Cheese and sativa favorite Cinderella 99. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Dairy Queen’s potency at between 14% and 28% THC.Dairy Queen’s flowers are medium to large and range in shape from spade-like to almost cylindrical. With a dense and chunky-looking structure, the buds appear more indica. The tightly-packed leaves are a dark shade of forest green and shot through with a high volume of pale brown pistils. Crystalline white trichomes give a sheen to these tight buds and make them difficult to break up.When properly cured, Dairy Queen’s flowers have a bright, fruity aroma. These tropical notes exist alongside the sour tang passed on from parent strain Cheese. Meanwhile, breaking the dense buds open yields some spicy, nutty scents. When burnt, these clashing flavor profiles create an acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and tickle the palate. While the taste of this harsh smoke may be objectionable to some, many find that it has a smooth, dessert-like aftertaste with hints of vanilla. Finally, smokers should note that this can be a particularly pungent smoke; those looking to maintain discretion should take precautions.Dairy Queen hits smokers relatively quickly, creating some changes in perception. External stimuli can take on a new dimension and seem more interesting than they otherwise might. In addition to this sensory distortion, smokers may detect some increased mental stimulation, resulting in freely-associative patterns of thought. This mindset comes without any of the disorienting effects that come with stronger, more cerebral strains, and allows users to remain lucid and able to work or converse. As time wears on, a mild sense of physical relaxation creeps in. The slow meld of mental and physical effects can be good for certain kinds of exercise and, notably, sex. In more low-energy situations, Dairy Queen is great for simply zoning out after a long day. It can be solo and introspective or buzzy and social. Beware, though, that as dosage increases, so does the likelihood of couchlock. Because it is so versatile, Dairy Queen is as appropriate for waking-and-baking as it is for enjoying as a bedtime treat.Dairy Queen can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to instill focus and concentration may be of use to those with attention deficit disorders. The strain’s mood-elevating effects can also ease the difficult symptoms of stress and depression, helping the afflicted to spend their time more presently and consciously. Physiologically, this bud may offers some degree of relief from deep-seated aches and pains or from everyday irritations like headaches. Because its high does not often lead to paranoid, recursive thinking, Dairy Queen is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.TGA Subcool sells seeds of Dairy Queen through several online retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Dairy Queen’s plants grow short and bushy and can easily be accommodated in indoor grow spaces. Growers should take time to “top” their crops, trimming away leaves that might block light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. This strain flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors. Additionally, just as it is a pungent smoke, this bud can be a very smell crop to grow; those looking to keep their growing operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Whether you’re enjoying it at home alone or out with some friends, Dairy Queen’s mellow high is sure to leave a lasting impression -- it may even leaving you craving some grub from this strain’s fast food namesake.\n"

        "description": "Sometimes, it’s refreshing to see a product deliver exactly what it promises. Deep Sleep will do just that, granting users a pervasive feeling of relaxation that eventually tapers into drowsiness and sleep. Created by L.A.-based Progressive Options (possibly explaining the strain’s alternative name of P.O. 4), this hybrid is a cross between Larry OG and the pre-98 cut of Bubba Kush. Deep Sleep’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 13% and 20%.Though small, flowers of Deep Sleep are impressively dense and solid. The buds, ranging in shape from spade-like to almost spherical, adhere in an indica-typical structure. The tightly-curling leaves are a mossy shade of green and are twisted through with fiery orange pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of the strain also boast flashes of purple in their leaves -- these surprising hues are the result of compounds called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics, which trigger bold colors when stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, these already-colorful flowers are coated with icy white trichomes, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity.When properly cured, flowers of Deep Sleep smell fruity, albeit with a slightly rank, fermented edge. On closer inspection, an astringent hint of diesel is also present. Meanwhile, breaking the buds open yields a more malted, nutty aroma. These flavors combined in a harsh, cough-inducing smoke when Deep Sleep is combusted. The smoke tastes fruity with some residual diesel fumes on the exhale. This can be a very pungent smoke -- those concerned with discretion should take the needed precautions. Notably, despite Deep Sleep’s often purple coloring, it has no discernible grape flavor; this is because a plant’s color and its aroma are determined by two separate compounds -- respectively, pigments and terpenes.Deep Sleep offers what’s best described as a creeper of a high. Several minutes after smokers have savored its unique taste, the strain begins to reveal itself, starting with a tingle that spreads down through the neck and core. Deep breathing may happen more easily and the stresses of the day may melt into the background as smokers sink into this bud’s cozy body high. Any discernible mental effects take the shape of slight sensory distortion. Some users also report a subtle uptick in freely-associative thinking. By and large, though, smokers should not plan on accomplishing any kind of demanding work after enjoying this strain. Deep Sleep’s mellow haze and easy euphoria are great for atmospheric activities like watching trippy movies or listening to ethereal music. As the high wears on, the likelihood of couchlock increases. It should come as no surprise, then, that Deep Sleep is recommended for use before bedtime, as it will renders most smokers useless if consumed earlier in the day.Medical cannabis patients may also find value in Deep Sleep’s strong, long-lasting sedation. It can work against even stubborn cases of insomnia, pulling smokers under into a deep, restful sleep. It may also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. Psychologically speaking, this strain’s ability to blunt tension and worries make it an effective temporary antidote to the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Because it’s very unlikely to bring about intense, recursive patterns of thinking, Deep Sleep is a good option for smokers who are prone to panic, or who have a low THC tolerance.No commercial-grade breeders have yet made seeds of Deep Sleep available for sale online. As such, prospective growers should seek out a trusted source from whom to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain; these clippings can then be grown as genetically identical “clones.” Because of their predominantly indica background, plants of deep sleep grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Growers should be sure to “top” their crops for maximum yield by occasionally trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves. Furthermore, those looking to bring out Deep Sleep’s impressive purple potential should expose their plants to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees lower than average. Deep Sleep can be a very pungent grow -- those looking to keep their indoor operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Deep Sleep is an excellent end-of-the-day (or week) strain to be savored, either alone or with friends. This kind of thorough, tranquilizing high only comes around every so often.\n"

        "description": "Dizzy OG is a well-balanced strain that makes the most of its OG Kush parentage. Like Willie Nelson and Snoop’s Dream, this hybrid is the signature breeding effort of a celebrity otherwise known for music; rapper Dizzy Wright developed this strain and has even been known to toss blunts out to the audience during shows. Rather than being just a vanity project, though, this bud may have staying power: it won 2nd Place in the category of Best Medicinal Hybrid in the 2016 High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup. Dizzy OG’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 22%.Dizzy OG is marked by medium-sized flowers that have a somewhat asymmetrical shape once trimmed. These buds adhere in a ragged structure, more typical of sativa varieties.The leaves are a vibrant shade of lime green and are threaded through with dark, rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from flowering male plants). A blanket of amber-colored trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces, giving these flowers a slightly yellowish sheen.Properly cured, Dizzy OG’s flowers carry the dank, woodsy aroma you might expect of a strain in the OG family. On closer inspection, though, they also have a sweet and slightly fruity kick. Tearing the nugs apart yields some surprisingly sour notes. When combusted, this strain burns with a thick smoke that may sting the palate and sinuses with its acrid, kushy odor. However harsh, though, this smoke has a pleasantly fruity and piney taste on the exhale.Dizzy OG offers a creeper of a high, taking several minutes after consumers have finished toking before revealing itself. Eventually, the strain’s effects manifest as a throb around the eyes and temples. This sensation is accompanied by a burst of energy and, for some, an ineffable feeling of euphoria. Smokers -- particularly those with a lower THC tolerance -- may feel an uptick in fast-paced cerebral thinking. In the right set and setting, users can maintain a lucid mindset and carry on conversations, allowing them to accomplish work ranging from mundane tasks like doing the dishes to more complicated, analytical jobs. As the high wears on, a physical tingle emerges, which serves to relax smokers and to take the edge off of any initial sativa effects. In social situations, this gradual comedown lends itself to camaraderie and even giggles among like-minded friends. At higher doses, the threat of couchlock begins to surface, soon rendering users happily immobile. Dizzy OG is best enjoyed at night; if consumed during the day, it’s liable to pave the way for a very unproductive afternoon.This even-tempered strain may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. In large enough amounts, it can work against insomnia, lulling users into a deep, fulfilling sleep. It can also relieve aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as from an injury, or chronic, as from conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Some anti-inflammatory effects can also soothe everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Psychologically, Dizzy OG’s tendency to elevate mood can provide temporary relief from mild to moderate stress and depression. Although its onset comes with some mental stimulation, it does not often bring about paranoia -- as such, this strain may be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Neither Dizzy Wright nor any licensed breeders have made seeds of Dizzy OG available for sale online. As such, prospective growers will need to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” There is little information available on specific best practices for growing this strain. We do know, however, that like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. We also know that its predecessor strain OG Kush flowers within a long 9 weeks when grown indoors.Somewhat difficult to come by, Dizzy OG is worth picking up for its middle-of-the-road effects. It’s a welcome additions to the stash boxes of indica and sativa lovers alike.\n"

        "description": "Not to be confused with the common nickname for dangerous synthetic marijuana, K2 is a hybrid with prestigious genetics. Originally bred in Amsterdam, this strain is a cross between indica landrace Hindu Kush and notoriously sticky White Widow Its name is a reference to the second-highest mountain in the world, Chhogori, on the China-Pakistan border, and may point not only to the bud’s South Asian origin, but also to the heights of euphoria that it offers. This strain has a rich, fruity, flavor profile and a high that, while balanced, tends more towards relaxation. K2’s potency has been measured at between 16% and a staggering 29%.While K2’s flowers may not be impressive in terms of size, they stand out with a very dense, compact structure that you’d expect of a predominantly indica strain. These buds range in shape from spade-like to pseudo-spherical. The tightly-coiled leaves are a mossy shade of green and are shot through with rust-colored pistils. Translucent white trichomes (likely passed on from parent strain White Widow) cover the inner and outer crevices of the flowers, accounting for their psychoactivity and giving them a particularly resinous texture.When properly cured, flowers of K2 give off the earthy suggestion of damp soil and wood. There’s also a slight lemony tang lurking underneath. Meanwhile, breaking up or grinding the buds yields some very skunky notes. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, K2 has been said to give off a harsh, acrid smoke that can tickle the sinuses or cause eyes to water. On the exhale, this smoke has a mixed dank and lemon flavor. Finally, K2 is said to be a particularly pungent smoke; those toking outdoors or in public may want to think twice or take proper precautions.K2 takes effect relatively quickly. Initial effects manifest as a throbbing pressure around the eyes and temples. Soon after, mental effects shuttle the smoker right to the apex of euphoria. Although the strain has a sativa onset, any effect on the mind is more emotionally impactful than cerebral. Smokers may experience some sensory distortion as well, with certain sights and sounds taking on unexpected new dimensions. These psychedelic qualities make K2 a great accompaniment to enjoying the great outdoors -- if not full-on mountain climbing, then at least some light hiking. Those expecting to find long-lasting focus with this bud may be disappointed, as it’s more likely to keep users easily distracted or suggestible. As the high wears on, K2’s indica side creeps in, conferring full-body relaxation. Limbs may feel thick and heavy, and movement may take some exertion; on the backend, this strain is better suited to spacing out indoors, with the mood set by a trippy movie or album. Because this strain can taper down into sedation and drowsiness, it may be more appropriate for evening or nighttime than for morning use.K2 may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can serve as an effective means of relief from aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. This strain can also provoke hunger, making it useful for patients who may have suffered loss of appetite due to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, K2 can temporarily take the edge off of the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Because it does not often lead to the kind of intense, recursive thinking associated with paranoia, this strain may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately, several commercial breeders have made seeds of K2 available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. K2 flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in September when grown outdoors; it typically offers a yield of about 37 to 46 grams (or 1.3 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.A great option whether you’re toking alone or with friends, K2 provides mellow, long-lasting relaxation. It’s a great all-purpose option for any hybrid aficionado.\n"

        "description": "Lucky Charms is a long-lasting, well-balanced hybrid with a crowd-pleasing taste. Created by Bodhi Seeds -- the same prolific growers who have created strains like Tiger’s Milk and Sunshine Daydream -- this bud is a cross between resinous The White and pungent Appalachia and has all the best psychoactive qualities of both. Like its namesake cereal, it offers bold and fruity flavors. Also like the cereal, Lucky Charms can be a great, energetic way to start the day if you’re so inclined. This strain’s THC has been measured at between 15% and 22%.Lucky Charms sets itself apart with large flowers that adhere in elongated, almost cylindrical clusters. The buds have a dense, indica-typical structure, with leaves tightly coiled around their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Much like parent strain The White, Lucky Charms is also absolutely coated in snowy trichomes that make the flowers difficult to break up without use of a quality grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Lucky Charms has a sweet and flowery aroma, with some traces of berry. On closer inspection, the buds also have hints of dank earth and some fresh pine. Grinding intensifies this earthy, hashy scent, possibly due to the Afghani in parent strain Appalachia’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Lucky Charms burns with a harsh smoke that may trigger coughing or watery eyes. Despite its harshness, though, this smoke has floral and subtle citrus flavors on the exhale.Lucky Charms has a one-two combination punch of effects, leaving smokers relaxed while still elevating their patterns of thinking. It can be a creeper, taking several minutes after consumers have finished toking before making its presence known. Eventually, smokers may notice that their thoughts take on a quick, freely-associative character. This feeling of mindrace can cause the uninitiated to feel somewhat out of control. In the right set and setting, though, Lucky Charms can put mental stress and static on mute while instilling physical calm; muscular tension may evaporate as deep breathing happens more easily. The strain’s sativa effects can also bring about some sensory warping like visual or auditory distortions, making for a uniquely trippy experience. With sufficient intent, Lucky Charms allows the user to focus on any tasks at hand, whether freewheeling and creative or rigid and analytical. As time passes, however, or as dosage is increased, the strain’s mild feeling of physical sedation intensifies, making it perfect for unwinding after a long day or week. Lucky Charms is great for a mellow night in alone or a buzzy night out with friends. It’s also versatile enough for morning to evening use, depending on an individual smoker’s tolerance or daily agenda.Not just a novelty strain, Lucky Charms can also be useful for medical cannabis patients. Its ability to sustain focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorder. It may also help those with mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more consciously and deliberately. Physiologically speaking, the bud’s sedative properties can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, as well as more minor annoyances like headaches or nausea. Because its early side effects include paranoia and mindrace, Lucky Charms may not be the best choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Bodhi has made seeds of the strain available for sale online. Once obtained, Lucky Charms can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend towards the taller side, so growers should take care to cut their crops back early in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in October when grown outdoors. It is known to offers a high yield of flowers for patient growers.Popular for both its taste and versatile effects, Lucky Charms is a must-try for hybrid fans. That said, the strain may soon run afoul of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission -- in 2016, the group banned the sale of strains like Bubblicious and Girl Scout Cookies, whose names could potentially (and unintentionally) appeal to children.\n"

        "description": "Pez is a pure indica bred from strong Asian landrace genetics -- it is a cross between Afghani and Pakistani varietals and offers all the thoroughgoing relaxation you’d expect from such a lineage. Although no breeder has officially claimed responsibility for creating this strain, some sources claim that it was developed by the University of Washington as a cancer treatment on Lopez Island (hence the nickname ‘Pez). Whatever its background, Pez is certainly potent: cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples to have between 12% and 27% THC.Pez’s flowers have a tapered, spadelike shape. These nuggets are small to medium in size and cling together in clustered, popcorn-like formations. The structure of the buds is undeniably indica, with a solid density; the leaves curl in tightly towards their central stems. Leaves themselves are a mossy shade of green and are shot through with orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from flowering male plants. Translucent trichomes give these colorful flowers a slightly matte white look.Like the candy of the same name, Pez has a predominantly sweet aroma, with strong berry notes. Lurking underneath is the earthy scent of fresh pine. Meanwhile, cracking open these nuggets yields a more hashy, incense-like odor, possibly passed on from the richly-perfumed Afghani. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Pez has a remarkably smooth smoke for an indica. On the exhale, this smoke has a tropical flavor with some citrusy hints.Pez offers a creeper of a high -- several minutes after savoring its fruity and earthy taste, smokers may notice a tingle spreading from the neck down through the core and limbs. Anxieties and any muscular tension melt away as users find themselves able to breathe more deeply and easily. This relaxation eventually progresses into a full body high, leaving smokers content to zone out as the outside world recedes into the background. To be sure, Pez confers a cloudy mental state that isn’t particularly conducive to getting work done. Users may also experience some changes in sensory perception, marked by visual and auditory distortions. Such a trippy vibe can set the stage for giddy social situations; this bud may facilitate free-flowing conversation or camaraderie among like-minded friends. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, smokers are likely to become couchlocked, and eventually, to drift off to sleep. As such, Pez is best enjoyed during the evening when its powerful sedation can be fully appreciated.Pez’s tranquilizing effects may also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. It can provide relief from aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The strain’s anti-inflammatory effects can also soothe more common irritations like headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, Pez may temporarily relieve the symptoms of stress, depression, and even anxiety. As noted, it can also counteract insomnia, lulling users into a deep and restful sleep. Because it is very unlikely to trigger the kind of recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, this strain is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial breeders have made seeds of Pez available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain, sourced from a trusted breeder, in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Like most indicas, Pez’s plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any broad-light blocking fan leaves, thereby encouraging the growth of flowering nodes on the crops’ lower branches. Pez flowers within in 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is said to offer a very high yield of flowers.Still a very popular strain in its birthplace of the Pacific Northwest, Pez’s long-lasting, therapeutic body high makes it a great addition to any indica lover’s stash box. That said, any entities growing or selling Pez in Oregon should take care not to run afoul of the state’s Liquor Control Commission, which in 2016 banned the sale of strains like Girl Scout Cookies and Bubblicious because their names could inadvertently appeal to children.\n"

        "description": "THC Bomb is a hybrid that, depending on the phenotype, can leave toward the indica or sativa end of the spectrum. It was created by Bomb Seeds, the same Dutch growers who have created similarly explosive strains like Berry Bomb. While Bomb Seeds has kept THC Bomb’s genetic background proprietary, this strain’s appeal is obvious. Besides a well-rounded earthy and fruity flavor profile, it delivers what it promises: THC levels have been reported at between 20% and 26%, making this bud a potent choice for cannabis novices and veterans alike.THC Bomb is marked by impressively large, bomb-like flowers. These buds have the dense, heavy structure often associated with indicas. The tightly-coiled leaves are a dark shade of forest green and contain a higher-than-average volume of bright orange pistils. These already-colorful flowers are also covered in shiny, translucent white trichomes that give them a shiny, dewy look.When properly cured, THC Bomb’s flowers have a dank, earthy scent with notes of wood and musk. On closer inspection, there are also some hints of lemon to brighten up the overall impression. Some consumers describe an astringent chemical funk, reminiscent of staple strain Chemdawg. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the buds has a slightly rank, fermented smell. THC Bomb’s smoke may be harsh and cough-inducing for some. On the exhale, the smoke carries a fruity, slightly diesel taste.This bomb detonates quickly, exerting pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. This odd physical sensation is accompanied by a rush of energy. Smokers may find themselves motivated to engage in active pursuits, ranging from exercising to simply cleaning the house. Also present is an uptick in cerebral thinking; thoughts may occur more frequently, and in a more freely-associative manner. This headspace can be useful for working on detailed, analytical projects or more creative daydreaming and brainstorming efforts. THC Bomb can also have some trippy sensory effects, including visual distortions and time dilation, that can be made all the more intense by atmospheric movies or music. As the high wears on, THC Bomb is characterized by increased relaxation which, if not couchlocking, is enough to eliminate any lingering muscular tension. This unique blend of mental and physical effects makes the strain great for activities that involve agility and coordination, like working out, dancing, and even sex. If dosage is increased, couchlock becomes increasingly likely -- in large enough amounts, falling asleep is not unheard of. Because its effects are so versatile, THC Bomb is appropriate for daytime or nighttime use (taking into account, of course, an individual user’s tolerance and daily agenda).Medical cannabis patients may also find value in THC’s wide-ranging effects. Its cerebral onset can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. The bud can also have a positive effect on mood, helping to temporarily relieve the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. On the physical side, the strain may soothe mild to moderate aches and pains. As noted, THC Bomb can also work against stubborn cases of insomnia. Because the early stages of its high may lead to intense, cerebral thinking, this strain is not recommended for users who are prone to panic or who have low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Bomb Seeds has made seeds of this strain available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors depends on a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants have an indica-typical silhouette, growing short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to “top” their crops by periodically trimming away broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Growers report that THC Bomb takes anywhere from a long 10 to 11 weeks to flower when grown indoors; it’s ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors. Finally, THC Bomb is known to offers a high yield of about 51 to 60 grams (1.8 to 2.1 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.THC Bomb’s long-lasting, dynamic high is a great way to enjoy social engagements or solo introspective time. The strain’s very high resin output also makes it valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Jager is a potent indica named after Jagermeister, a popular German brand of licorice schnapps. And while the alcoholic beverage is fabled to contain traces of deer’s blood, the strain has no such unsavory ingredients. Jager was created by an as-yet unidentified breeder in Oregon and may be the product of popular staples Blue Dream and L.A. Confidential. Like the booze, this bud is very potent, consistently testing at between 18% and 23% THC.Jager immediately establishes its bag appeal with large, chunky flowers. The flowers have a spade-like shape, almost resembling pine cones, tapering down from a broad base to a pointed tip. The buds adhere in a dense, indica-typical structure with dark green leaves and rust-colored pistils. Most phenotypes of the strain also boast streaks of deep purple -- these striking colors are the byproduct of colder-than-average weather affecting the plants’ pigments (called anthocyanins) during the growing process. These already-colorful flowers are also coated in translucent amber trichomes, accounting for their psychoactivity and giving them a very sticky texture.Like its namesake liquor, Jager has a pronounced aroma of black licorice. When inspected more closely, dank scents of musk and damp earth are also at play. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open these dense buds yield some traces of diesel. This strain has a surprisingly smooth smoke for an indica; on the exhale, this smoke has a herbal, tobacco-like flavor, along with some sweet licorice that lingers on the palate. Notably, Jager offers no grape flavors, despite its often entirely purple flowers -- this is because the pigments that determine the leaves’ color do not have a corresponding effect on their aroma.Jager hits hard and fast, often making its effects known before smokers have finished savoring its rich smoke. Users typically detect a tingle that spreads from the neck down through the core and limbs. Any muscular tension may gradually dissipate as deep breathing happens more deeply and easily. These effects progress toward a full body high that may make some want to stretch out on the closest possible couch. Despite its relaxing properties though, Jager has enough sativa potency to confer a clearheaded energy; this makes the bud useful for mentally engaging pursuits like reading, studying, or plowing through administrative work. Alternatively, these acute but relaxed vibes can be a great way to stimulate conversation or camaraderie among friends. Eventually, Jager’s high progresses towards sleepiness -- and while the alcoholic namesake often renders its consumers unconscious, this bud’s knockout effect is more subtle, without the subsequent hangover and embarrassing loss of control. Jager is best enjoyed in the early evening or right before bed. Finally, its effects are said to be long-lasting, even for cannabis veterans.Jager’s relaxing properties may also be worth sampling by medical cannabis patients. The strain can numb deep-seated aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. It can also take care of minor annoyances like headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, Jager may temporarily blunt the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. In large enough doses, it can also soothe insomniacs to sleep. Because it is unlikely to bring about overly cerebral thinking or paranoia, Jager is a good option for users who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Since no commercial-scale breeders have made seeds of the strain available for sale online, those looking to grow Jager must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow “clones.” The bud is said to be an easy grow for newcomers to cultivation, as it is particularly resistant to mold. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Predominantly indica genes means that plants will grow short and bush; growers should regularly trim away any fan leaves that could block light and air from stimulating low-growing flowering nodes. Finally, growers looking to bring out Jager’s full dark purple potential should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are 10 to 15 degrees colder than average, just before flowering begins.While Jagermeister liquor is often considered a “pre-game” psychoactive enhancement, Jager bud is more of a nightcap for relaxing before bed. Its moody, mellow effects are just the thing for unwinding after a long day or week.\n"

        "description": "Lucid Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid that offers a stimulating high and a sweet berry flavor. Named after a phenomenon in which the dreamer is able to exert control over the content and action of his or her dreams, Lucid Dream indeed offers a mindset that is hazy and active at the same time. Although no commercial breeders have claimed responsibility for creating this strain, that hasn’t stopped it from gaining popularity. A cross between Amnesia Haze and the uber-popular Blue Dream, Lucid Dream is sure to appeal to fans of both of its parent strains. This bud’s potency has been tested at between 15% and 28% THC.Lucid Dream has small to medium-sized flowers than range in shape from roughly circular to tapered and almost conical. The leaves -- which are densely packed in an indica-typical formation -- are a pale shade of olive green. In some cases, the flowers also boast patches of dark purple, almost to the exclusion of green; this is the result of a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn, in which the plant’s pigments are excited by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, icy white trichomes dot these flowers, accounting for their potency and giving them a very sticky texture. If properly cured, Lucid Dream has all the fruity pungency of Blue Dream. An unmistakable blueberry scent wafts up from the flowers, accented by an earthy funk. On closer inspection, there’s also a slightly tropical aroma, redolent of pineapple. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, the bud gives off a smooth, easily palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke has an herbal flavor that may be familiar to those used to smoking Haze variants. Notably, despite its striking purple color, Lucid Dream does any discernible grape flavor -- this is because the pigments that determine the bud’s color do not have a corresponding effect on its taste. As with many other sativa hybrids, Lucid Dream has a high that hits quickly. Almost immediately, users report a floaty, psychedelic experience characterized by strong sensory distortion and a feeling of time dilation. Such qualities make this strain a great way to enhance an otherwise low-key day. Despite its dreamy character, though, the high is given an edge by the presence of Amnesia Haze. Shortly after adjusting to this strain’s relaxing properties, smokers may detect an increase in cerebral thinking; this makes Lucid Dream great for work productivity, whether the work in question is analytical and no-nonsense or creative and freewheeling. Alternatively, this euphoric bud may set the stage for some passive relaxation and introspection. In any case, smokers shouldn’t expect a burst of energy -- although Lucid Dream is great for mentally engaging tasks, it’s not well suited to intense physical activities. Trying to get around under this strain’s influence is akin to walking through peanut butter. Because of its versatile effects, Lucid Dream is appropriate for use at any time of day, provided that no physical exertion is on the agenda.Lucid Dream can also have wide-ranging effects for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily dull the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also keep those with attention deficit disorders calm and focused enough to work on a single task. Physiologically, this strain can soothe aches and pains, whether serious and chronic or temporary. Although it’s mostly calming, Lucid Dream should be consumed with moderation by those who are prone to panic, since its onset may lead to some mindrace.No commercial breeders have made seeds of Lucid Dream available for sale online. As such, home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to cultivate genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors depends on a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Those looking to bring out the bold purple streaks associated with this bud should briefly expose their plants to nighttime temperatures 10 to 15 degrees colder than average. Lucid Dream flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.This mystical bud is a must-try for sativa and indica fans alike. Its unique mix of mellow dreaminess and mental acuity sets it apart from other boutique hybrids.\n"

        "description": "The pitbull dog breed has gained an unfair reputations for being dangerous and overly aggressive. The strain of the same name, while very potent, is anything but vicious. It was developed by Stoney Girl Gardens, a group of Portland-based breeders who have created flavorful and locally-themed strains like Marionberry. Pitbull is a cross between P-91 and Stoney Girl’s own sativa Sugar Plum. Though the breeder claims THC levels as high as 36%, independent cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found the bud to have between 10% and 21% THC.Pitbull impresses with medium to large-sized nuggets that adhere in a surprisingly loose and fluffy bud structure. The flowers are roughly spade-shaped. Olive green leaves are twisted through with vibrant orange pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of this strain will show off streaks of purple in their leaves; these hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover these buds, giving them a slightly dewy sheen.When properly cured, Pitbull gives off a pleasantly fruity, tropical odor with distinct lemon-lime notes. On closer inspection, there’s also an underlying funk, likely passed on from pungent grandparent strain Northern Lights. Breaking open or grinding the buds yields a floral aroma with some spicy accents. When combusted, this strain burns with a harsh and acrid smoke that may trigger coughing for some. Refreshment returns on the exhale, though, with an herbal-tasting smoke, reminiscent of sage.Pitbull’s high comes on quickly for an indica. Initial effects manifest as a tingle around the face, particularly the eyes and temples. A heavy, full-body stone arrives soon after, rendering any anxiety or discomfort null. This indica is unique in that its couchlock takes hold relatively early, pinning smokers passively in place. Users may experience weird sensory effects, including distorted depth perception and slight auditory hallucinations. Any other mental side effects have a cloudy, dopey character; this is not a strain for intense cerebral activity or problem-solving. Instead, savor this sleepy strain as you lounge around at home, zoning out to some atmospheric music or trippy movies. Alternatively, use Pitbull to enhance your appreciation of the great outdoors on a camping trip or around a fire pit. This bud’s easygoing vibes are as enjoyable solo as they are with a group of close, like-minded friends. In high enough doses, beware that this strain can lull you into a deep and restful sleep. Pitbull is best enjoyed at nighttime -- or at least during a lazy, unproductive day.Many medical cannabis patients may also find value in Pitbull’s strong, almost narcotic levels of sedation. It can be a great way to soothe pain, whether temporary as due to injury, or chronic and nerve-related as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. The strain may also relieve more minor irritations like headaches and nausea. As noted, Pitbull can also work against insomnia, granting much-needed rest for the sleep-deprived. Psychologically speaking, this strain’s ability to elevate mood can be a good temporary antidote to mild to moderate stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it is unlikely to bring about intense, paranoid patterns of thinking, this bud is recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Stoney Girl Gardens only sells seeds of Pitbull through licensed brick-and-mortar retailers and has not made them available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Fortunately, Pitbull is a hardy grow, resistant to mold, mites, and other adverse conditions, making it a great option for newcomers to cultivation. Plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and are easily accommodated indoors. Those looking to bring out the flowers’ full purple potential should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average. Pitbull flowers within a brief 6 to 7 weeks when grown indoors.A great choice for a slow and mellow evening, Pitbull should have a home in any indica lover’s stash box. Although mostly popular in the Pacific Northwest, there’s not much stopping this bud from enjoying international fame like its alternative namesake, Mr. Worldwide.\n"

        "description": "Along with THC, CBD is one of the miracle components of cannabis. Short for cannabidiol, CBD provides all the physical relaxation of a potent indica, but with less of the psychedelic high that comes with higher concentrations of THC. CBD Kush, created by the prolific Dutch Passion Seeds, is a strain specifically bred to yield a balance between THC and CBD effects. It is a cross between an unspecified, CBD-rich strain and the citrusy Kandy Kush. CBD Kush has between 1% to 8% THC and as much as 7% to 11% CBD.CBD Kush impresses with large bud that are almost spherical in shape. The chunky flowers adhere in an indica-typical bud structure, with leaves coiled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a bright shade of emerald green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Because it’s genetically geared for low amounts of THC, this strain has a low volume of resin; any trichomes that are present are amber-colored, giving the flowers a slightly yellow sheen.When properly cured, CBD Kush has an aroma that is simultaneously sweet and dank, like overripe fruit. On closer inspection, the woodsy scent of pine hangs underneath. Meanwhile, breaking open the buds yields rich notes of hash and incense, possibly passed on from the Afghani landrace in this strain’s background. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, CBD Kush gives off a harsh and acrid smoke that may smell unpleasant for many, agitating the palate and causing eyes to water. Anyone intent on enjoying this bud in public should note that it can be a particularly pungent and indiscreet smoke.To the extent that CBD Kush has any kind of high to speak of, this high creeps up slowly, sometimes taking as much as 15 minutes after smokers have exhaled before making itself apparent. Then again, the bud’s psychoactivity is so subtle that users may have to wait even longer in order to detect its effects. Eventually, a subtle tingle of relaxation spreads from the neck down through the core and limbs. This mildly sedative feeling characterizes the strain’s effects; rather than a traditional high, smokers are more likely to feel a pervasive sense of physical ease and fluidity. While slightly disorienting for some, this intense relaxation can contribute to full-on euphoria in the right set and setting. CBD Kush can be a great way to unwind alone or with a small group of friends. Although the CBD in this bud may ease tension and free up mental energy for complex tasks, the strain is not cerebral per se. Additionally, even though it may not pin users to the couch, CBD Kush can set the stage for a good night’s sleep. Because its effects are so versatile and subtle, this strain is appropriate for use at any time of day.CBD Kush’s medical uses may be more highly valued than its recreational ones. Primarily, this strain can offer relief from deep-seated aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. Its anti-inflammatory properties can also soothe everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. As noted, the high concentration of CBD can allow for fewer distractions, allowing those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on a single task. Finally, CBD Kush can elevate mood, providing temporary refuge from stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it carries little to no risk of recursive, cerebral thought patterns, CBD Kush is a good option for users who are prone to panic; it’s also of use to patients who want to take advantage of its therapeutic value without getting uncomfortable stoned.Dutch Passion has made seeds of this potent strain available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants typically grow short and bushy; as such, growers should periodically trim away any broad fan leaves that can stop light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. CBD Kush flowers within a long 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers patient growers a high yield for their efforts. Finally, just as this strain can be a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow; those looking to keep their indoor cultivation discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Medically effective strains like CBD Kush can help to shatter some of the stigma that still surrounds cannabis use. Although somewhat difficult to come by, this strain should be snatched up if spotted on dispensary shelves for its mellow and therapeutic effects.\n"

        "description": "Cannabis breeding has produced plenty of novelty flavor pairings. Pacific Northwest-born strain Black Cherry Cheesecake is no exception. This fruity strain is said to be a cross between TGA Genetics’ Black Cherry Soda, sativa favorite Super Silver Haze, and pungent hybrid Cheese. The result is a bold, indica-dominant strain that boasts colorful flowers as well as a crowd-pleasing taste. This fruity bud’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 10% and 21% THC.Flowers of Black Cherry Cheesecake are large and strikingly well-formed. The spade-shaped buds taper from a broad base into a pointed tip and adhere in the dense, solid structure typically associated with indicas. Leaves are a pale shade of green and are shot through with bright orange pistils. Frequently, the leaves also have patches of pink and pale lavender; these pastel hues are the result of pigments (called anthocyanins) in the plants’ genetics which become activated in cold weather during the growing process. Sticky, silvery trichomes -- passed on from parent strain Super Silver Haze -- dot the inner and outer surfaces of these already-colorful flowers.When properly cured, these flowers indeed smell like black cherry -- this unique blend is passed on from parent strain Black Cherry Soda. As this strain’s name implies, the faintly acrid tang of cheese also hangs out underneath, although the two odors exist side-by-side rather than melding in a pleasant cheesecake blend. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Black Cherry Cheesecake burns with a smoke that can be harsh, tickling the palate and sinuses. This smoke can taste cheesy and slightly herbal on the exhale.Black Cherry Cheesecake offers a creeper of a high that may take as many as 10 minutes before fully revealing its effects. Surprisingly, both mental and physical effects take hold at once: smokers may feel a tingle spreading down through the neck and core at the same time as they develop a newfound interest in otherwise mundane topics. Users should expect to become immobilized if they’re already lounging in comfortable surroundings; if out and about, they may want to seek refuge and isolation. Even when sedated, though, smokers of Black Cherry Cheesecake are able to remain lucid and engaged; although not overly cerebral, the bud’s head high helps conversation flow easily, and allows users to focus on any work in front of them. This strain can be giddy and social if consumed in the right setting with the right companions, facilitating mellow feelings of camaraderie and relaxation. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Black Cherry Cheesecake’s physical effects intensify. In its later stages, the bud can bring about some sensory distortions like changes in depth perception. Because of its slide into sedation, Black Cherry Cheesecake is best enjoyed at nighttime.This fruity strain can have several benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its consistent and smooth feeling of focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on a single task. Its pervasive physical relaxation may also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to nerve damage or conditions like lupus. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory effects can take care of minor irritations like nausea or headaches. Because it is unlikely to bring about intense cerebral thinking or paranoia, Black Cherry Cheesecake is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No breeders have taken responsibility for creating this unique strain, and none have made seeds commercially available. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best practice for cultivating this specific strain, we know that, like many hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. We also know that growers intent on bringing out the flowers’ pink and purple hues should expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Black Cherry Cheesecake is an ideal strain for unwinding after a long day or week of work. Its novelty flavor is a bonus that may attract the attention of friends or passersby -- if you’re breaking it out in social situations, be sure to bring enough to share.\n"

        "description": "Haze Berry is a sativa-dominant hybrid that leans on some prestigious genetics to deliver a potent and long-lasting high. Created by prolific Dutch breeders Royal Queens Seeds -- the same people who have given us Blue Mystic and Royal Cheese, Haze Berry is a cross between Super Silver Haze and fruity staple Blueberry. Definitely a better choice for get-up-and-go sativa lovers, this strain imparts more head-focused concentrations that bodily relaxation. That said, the bud’s initial sativa stimulation eventually melts into a mellow, holistic high that’s enjoyable in a variety of settings. Haze Berry’s THC content has been measured at between 20% and 22% THC. Some phenotypes have also been reported to contain significant amounts of CBD.Flowers of Haze Berry are somewhat visually unimpressive; they are also small to medium in size and, despite their mostly sativa genetics, hold together in dense, popcorn-like clusters. The mossy green leaves are twisted through with curly golden-brown hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Parent strain Super Silver Haze also passes on some cloudy white trichomes, giving these flowers a silvery sheen and a very sticky texture.What these flowers lack in visuals, they more than make up for in scent. As with parent strain Blueberry, this primary aroma that wafts up from this bud is that of fresh blueberries. This fruity profile is accented by some sweet notes of vanilla. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the bud yields hints of spice and damp earth. When combusted, Haze Berry burns with a smooth and palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke carries a distinctly herbal flavor, likely passed on from the Haze in the bud’s lineage.Haze Berry takes hold quickly, initially apparent as a throbbing around the eyes and the temples. As users acclimate to this strange physical sensation, they may notice some changes in perception; while some only have a slight feeling of time slowing down, others pick up on psychedelic effects like visual and auditory distortions. For many, Haze Berry imparts a strong cerebral character, with thoughts jumping rapidly from one to the next in free association. This feeling of mindrace can be great for creative brainstorming or for powering through intense analytical tasks. Conversely, this mental stimulation may lead to the kind of recursive thinking patterns that can result in paranoia. In the right set and setting, though, Haze Berry may feel euphoric and uniquely social, bringing about the desire to spend time around companions and loved ones. As the high wears on, some slight physical relaxation creeps in to ground out this strain’s bold head high. Because of its energetic nature, Haze Berry is recommended for daytime use; it may leave smokers wired if consumed at night.This sativa’s head-focused properties can have many benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its enduring, lucid focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on a single task. Its ability to alter mood may also help patients with mild to moderate depression to spend their time more consciously and presently. Physiologically, the bud can relieve deep-seated aches and pains, as well as more minor irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can easily trigger paranoia, Haze Berry is not recommended for users who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, Royal Queen has made seeds of Haze Berry available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants are easily accommodated indoors, where they rarely exceed 3 feet in height. Like many sativas, Haze Berry has a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors; crops are ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. Growers should expect a yield of about 49 to 53 grams (or 1.7 to 1.9 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Although somewhat difficult to come by in retail settings, Haze Berry is a no-brainer for sativa lovers who value flavor as much as potency. This strain’s long-lasting mental effects are just the thing for intense, undisturbed concentration.\n"

        "description": "Somango is a fruity, indica-dominant hybrid with distinct notes of mango and berry. Soma Seeds, the creators of Lavender and Rock Bud, have claimed responsibility for this tropical strain. It is a cross between three wildly different buds: Big Skunk Korean, Super Skunk, and perennial favorite hybrid Jack Herer. With surprisingly energetic and mentally-focused effects, Somango is sure to please indica and sativa lovers alike. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 23%; some phenotypes are also bred for moderate levels of CBD.Somango sets itself apart with large flowers that are spade-shaped, tapering from a wide base at the stem to a pointed tip. The buds also have a sativa-like structure, appearing loose and fluffy with leaves easily torn away from their central stems. Leaves themselves are an olive green and are shot through with vibrant orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of Somango also contain streaks of deep blue and purple in their flowers. These colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins are agitated by cold weather as the plants grow; the process is similar in principle to the changing of foliage in autumn. A blanket of translucent white trichomes covers these already-colorful flowers, giving them a dewy sheen and making them very sticky to the touch.Somango bursts with a tropical aroma that blends fresh orange with a slightly herbal, peppery note -- this flavor profile will be very familiar to devoted fans of Jack Herer. Many consumers also pick up on the distinct taste of mango in these flowers. The dank odor of skunk hangs out underneath these bright scents and is intensified when buds are ground up or broken open. Somango burns with a surprisingly harsh smoke that may trigger coughing fits. This smoke tastes herbal on the exhale with a fruity, fermented edge. Notably, Somango has no discernible grape flavors or scents; this is because the pigments that determine its purple coloring do not have a corresponding effect on its taste.The high from this strain creeps up slowly, only manifesting several minutes after smokers have savored its taste. Initial effects emerge as a weighty feeling in the arms and legs, as well as a subtle pressure around the eyes and temples. These physical sensations are soon accompanied by a surge of mental stimulation -- fortunately, though, this bud’s pervasive body stone prevents the cerebral effects from becoming overwhelming, and mindrace is not commonly reported. With a relaxed body and an unfettered mind, the smoker may be more receptive to creative energy and able to easily brainstorm. Alternatively, Somango has enough sativa potency and focus to allow for concentration on complex, analytical tasks. In less productive settings, this bud can facilitate conversation and giggly vibes among like-minded friends. Somango’s blend of mental and physical effects also makes it an effective aphrodisiac.Somango’s versatile effects can also be of use to many medical cannabis patients. Several consumers report fast-acting and effective relief from pain, both temporary and chronic. Meanwhile, the strain’s anti-inflammatory properties can soothe minor irritations like nausea and headaches. Psychologically speaking, Somango’s mood-elevating properties can temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. In high enough doses, this bud may even lull insomniacs into a deep, restful sleep. Because it is unlikely to lead to intense patterns of recursive thinking, Somango is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately, seeds of Somango are available from several online retailers. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to be on the taller side and, if nurtured indoors, may requires growers to do some early training and pruning. Additionally, growers looking to bring out Somango’s violet hues should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures late in the vegetative stage. Somango flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors.Somango’s smooth, wide-ranging effects make it a great choice for use at any time of day and as an accompaniment to almost any activity. Its uniquely tropical aroma may also be a great social asset, as it’s likely to turn heads if broken out at parties.\n"

        "description": "With a high that’s as provocative as its name, Sexxpot is an indica strain specifically developed to help boost female libido. Created by innovator and marketed Karyn Wagner, who sought to create an aphrodisiac strain after smoking the arousing Mr. Nice, this is a fragrant variety that provides a mild but stimulating body and head buzz. This sex-positive bud is a cross between fabled mind control experiment drug G-13 and heavy indica Hash Plant. Don’t expect to be knocked out, though -- with only about 15% THC, this strain isn’t liable to interfere with your daily agenda.Flowers of Sexxpot aren’t particularly eye-catching, with small buds clinging together in dense, popcorn-like form. The mossy green leaves are coiled tightly around their central stems and are twisted through with pale yellow and orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of the strain also display flashes of purple in their leaves; these hues are the result of a process in which pigments called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Only a light dusting of white trichomes covers the outer surfaces of these flowers, accounting for their relatively low THC content.When properly cured, Sexxpot carries a tropical, fruity aroma. There are also some bright floral accents hanging out underneath. Some users pick on a sour, skunky character as well. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Sexxpot gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the sinuses and palate. This smoke has a fruity taste on exhale, along with a skunk, slightly fermented aftertaste.Sexxpot has a high that takes hold quickly, first exerting pressure around the eyes and temples and then conferring a slight dizzy feeling. Though it’s a mostly indica strain, some initial sativa effects can be detected; external stimuli like bright lights or loud sounds make seem more interesting than they otherwise might. There’s also an uptick in freely-associative thinking and a definite lowering of inhibitions that lends itself to creative thinking. At this point, a subtle body buzz may set in as well, relieving tension and allowing for slow, deep breathing. Sexxpot’s easygoing vibes work particularly well in social situations. The combination of mental and physical effects also lends itself to activities that involve both body and mind, like exercise, playing video games, and, as this strain makes clear, sex -- indeed, the same unfettered mental energy that allows creative users to brainstorm also frees them up to have exciting, stimulating sex. Because it is neither overly buzz nor overly sedative, Sexxpot is appropriate for use at any time of day. Besides the obvious stated goals of increasing sexual desire and potency, Sexxpot may have several other uses for medical cannabis patients. It can soothe acute aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The bud’s anti-inflammatory effects can also take care of annoyances like headaches and nausea. On the psychological side of the spectrum, Sexxpot can temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Finally, because this strain is not likely to bring about the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, it is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Seeds of Sexxpot are not available for sale online. As such, those looking to grow this therapeutic strain at home must obtain clipigns from mature plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there’s little information available regarding specific best practices for growing Sexxpot, we know that, like many indicas, it may fare best indoors where its bushy, laterally-spreading plants are easily accommodated. Additionally, those looking to bring out the flowers’ blue and purple bag appeal should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees colder than average.Sexxpot is currently only available in California, and only through the delivery service Lady Chatterly’s. If you’re lucky enough to be in range, pick some up for yourself or for a deserving woman in your life. For an extra kick, pair this arousing bud with some psychoactive personal lubricant! If sex isn’t on the menu, Sexxpot is also a great strain to enhancing some social bonding for a raucous night out or a mellow night in.\n"

        "description": "LA Woman, named after a hit Doors song and album, is a potent strain that’s worthy of Lizard King Jim Morrison himself. It is the brainchild of DNA Genetics, the prolific creators of Chocolope and 707 Headband, and is a cross between buzzy hybrid LA Confidential and the potent Mean Green. With a rich, dank flavor profile and a trippy, long-lasting high, this bud is a crowd-pleaser across the board. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 gives LA Woman high marks, having testing samples of the strain at between 13% and a whopping 28% THC.LA Woman has a bag appeal that’s clear almost immediately. Its flowers are long and tapered, appearing almost cylindrical in shape. The buds adhere in the relatively loose, fluffy structure commonly associated with sativa-dominant varieties. The soft leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these skinny flowers.Flowers of LA Woman have a predominantly sweet and earthy aroma, redolent of damp soil and musk. A fresh, sharp scent of pine balances out these dank notes. Meanwhile, grinding up or tearing apart these buds yields a rich, hashy odor -- after all, parent strain LA Confidential is descended from pungent Afghani landrace strains. LA Woman burns with a harsh, acrid smoke when combusted; this smoke has a sweet, slightly citric character on exhale, similar to that of scented cleaning products.This high is best described as a creeper, often taking up to 15 minutes after users have toked before revealing its effects. Eventually, smokers will detect a heaviness in the limbs and eyelids that may inspire them to dive for the closest horizontal surface. This early body high is accompanied by some mental stimulation. Users may find themselves engaged in rapid, free-flowing conversation as their thoughts begin to ramble. LA Woman may also bring about some sensory distortion; changes in depth perception are commonly reported, as is a striking sense of time dilation. Such trippy, psychedelic effects can be amplified by putting on an atmospheric movie or some ambient music (maybe The Doors’ Greatest Hits?) in the background. In the right set and setting, this strain can be social and giddy. It’s especially great for enjoying a camping trip or a similar excursion into the great outdoors. Smokers may slide into an entrenched body high on the backend, making them less likely to engage in active pursuits. Indeed, couchlock is a definite possibility in LA Woman’s later stages. Because of this taper off into sleepy effects, this strain is recommended for use during the late afternoon or early evening.LA Woman may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It may relieve deep-seated aches and pains, as well as spasms, cramps, and other discomforts caused by inflammation. Several smokers report persistent hunger as a side effect, making LA Woman an appealing option for those who may struggle with appetite due to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, this strain may temporarily improve the distracting symptoms of stress, depression, and even anxiety. Because it is unlikely to trigger overly intense cerebral thinking, this bud may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, DNA Genetics has made seeds of LA Woman available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This bud flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and rewards patient growers with a yield of about 37 to 56 grams (1.3 to 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Indoor growers should also be advised that this can be a particularly pungent grow; those looking to keep their operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Even if you’re enjoying this bud far from the luxury of L.A., LA Woman allows for full-bodied holistic relaxation that’s at home in any environment. This well-balanced strain is a must-try for sativa and indica lovers alike.\n"

        "description": "Mountain Girl is a strain named after Carolyn Garcia, devoted psychonaut, activist, and former wife of Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia. This bud was created by Oregon-based Pilot Farms as a cross between Willy’s Wonder, Grandaddy Purple, and the notorious White Widow. Mountain Girl offers a head-focused buzz, complemented by a rich, earthy flavor profile. Sure to impress cannabis newcomers and novices alike, Mountain Girl has a THC content that’s been measured at between 17% and 20%.Mountain Girl sets itself apart with medium to large buds that hold an almost spherical shape. The nugs adhere in a dense, indica-typical structure, with leaves coiled tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a vibrant lime green and are threaded through with curly brown to orange pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of the strain will boast streaks of blue and violet -- these surprising hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics are agitated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, White Widow passes on a propensity for trichome production, coating these already-colorful flowers in translucent resin secretions.When properly cured, Mountain Girl smells fruity and dank, with hints of black licorice. There’s also a skunky tang lurking underneath. Grinding up or breaking open these solid buds gives off a more musky odor. When combusted, the strain burns with a thick, acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and trigger coughing or watery eyes. This smoke has a skunky flavor on the exhale with a slight hint of pine. Notably, despite some shades of purple, Mountain Girl has no discernible grape flavors; this is because the color of its leaves is determined by pigments, while the leaves’ aroma is dictated by separate compounds called terpenes.Mountain Girl asserts itself quickly, exerting a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. As they adjust to these odd physical sensations, users may also feel an uptick in their thinking patterns, with thoughts jumping from one to the next. Although some may find the experience overwhelming, in the right set and setting, this cerebral spin can facilitate social vibes and stimulating conversation; alternatively, some smokers may want to engage in productivity, using this bud’s mental focus to power through work. In less active circumstances, Mountain Girl may endow users with a euphoric energy, helping them to feel present and engaged in the world around them. It can also serve as a handy way to enhance tedious activities like cleaning the house or running errands. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, a body stone creeps in, making limbs feel weighty and tingly. Nevertheless, Mountain Girl never becomes completely incapacitating. This buzzy bud is a quintessential wake-and-bake strain; consumed at night, it’s liable to keep smokers awake and overly wired.Mountain Girl can also have far-reaching benefits for medical cannabis patients. It may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic and nerve-related. It can also provoke hunger, making it an aid for those who many have lost their appetites to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, Mountain Girl’s long-lasting sense of focus can help patients with attention deficit disorders to work on single tasks. It can also help to temporarily distract those suffering from mild to moderate stress and depression, helping them to spend their time more consciously and presently. Because it can easily lead to an overwhelming feeling of “mindrace,” Mountain Girl should be consumed with caution by those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Pilot Farms has not made seeds of this strain available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on best practices specific to cultivation of this strain, we know that, like many hybrids, it can grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Additionally, those looking to bring out the bud’s full bag appeal should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins.Somewhat difficult to come by outside of the Pacific Northwest, Mountain Girl is worth snatching up for its richly-perfumed flowers and buzzy mental effects. It’s a potent and enjoyable smoke even if you don’t feel at home in the mountains like its namesake Carolyn Garcia.\n"

        "description": "Although it may not give you superpowers worthy of a Michael Bay action movie, Transformer is a potent bud that’s liable to provide an energetic new outlook. This balanced strain was created by Gage Green Genetics, holistically-minded growers who supply West Coast dispensaries with seeds and flowers. Transformer is a cross between two of Gage Green’s own boutique strains -- the even-handed Inferno Haze and the pungent Joseph OG. The result is a hybrid whose effects are buzzy and eye-opening. Transformer’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 22%.Large flowers establish this strain’s bag appeal from the get-go. Their shape, with an elongated, almost cylindrical structure, is also visually appealing. The relatively loose and fluffy leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are twisted through with bright orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. Cloudy white trichomes dot the surfaces of Transformer’s flowers, giving them a white sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Transformer’s buds burst with a rich, fruity scent. This refreshing citrus aroma is undercut by a funky, Kushy odor. Meanwhile, grinding up the buds or breaking them apart gives off distinct notes of woodsy pine. When combusted, Transformer burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke carries a fruity and herbal taste on the exhale, somewhat reminiscent of grandparent strain and breeding staple Haze.Transformer wastes no time, hitting users quickly with a tingle around the eyes and the front of the forehead. Initial effects manifest in smokers’ heads, leading them to become absorbed in their own thoughts; some may also detect changes in sensory perception, with certain sights and sounds seeming more intense than they otherwise might. This engaged and thoughtful mindset can be a great way to power through a load of work -- whether it’s creative and open-ended or more analytical and problem-oriented. Transformer can also enhance exercise with its physical energy and positive mental vibes. As the high wears on or as dosage is bumped up, a mild body buzz sets in. This physical high is marked by weighty limbs, heavy eyelids, and, in a secure and comfortable setting, a tendency to zone out. Whether smokers end up energized or relaxed, Transformer is a good strain in social settings, where it can inspired camaraderie and free-flowing conversation. Alternatively, enjoyed alone, it can provoke much-needed introspection. Because its effects are so versatile and neither overly stimulating or sedative, Transformer is appropriate for use at any time of day.Transformer’s far-reaching effects may also have application for medical cannabis patients. Primarily, it can aid focus for those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on a single task at once. The strain may also temporarily relieve some of the difficult symptoms of stress and depression. Somatically speaking, Transformer can dull aches and pains, whether they’re incidental, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe more everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Transformer is not recommended for patients who may be prone to panic, as its early sativa effects can bring about the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia.Seeds of Transformer are available through several digital retailers. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight and temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This strain’s sativa genes express themselves in very tall plants; if cultivating indoors, growers should prune their crops early in the vegetative stage to train them to fit in limited space. Additionally, as flowers proliferate, growers may need to support branches with artificial support like stakes or wooden dowels. Transformer flowers within a long 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors.After harvest, growers should also be sure to cure their buds. Curing requires trimmed flowers to be hung upside-down for a week in 70-degree surroundings with 50% humidity. Once dry, the buds should be sealed in airtight containers and stored in slightly more moist conditions of 60-65% humidity.Transformer is a must for indica and sativa lovers alike. If breaking it out at a party, be sure to bring enough to share, as its rich, complex aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Sometimes known as Lemon Cheesecake, Lemon Cake is a sativa-dominant hybrid that combines two recognizable -- albeit clashing -- strains. Created by Heavyweight Seeds, the European company responsible for flavor-focused strains like Fruit Punch, this bud is a cross between Lemon Skunk and pungent staple Cheese. It offers a jolt of sativa energy that tapers into full-bodied relaxation. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has rated Lemon Cake’s potency as between 12% and an impressive 25%.When properly grown and trimmed, flowers of Lemon Cake are medium to large in size. They are conically shaped, tapering down from a broad base at the stem to a narrow pointed end. These buds hold together in a surprisingly loose, piecey structure, with wispy leaves jutting out at sharp angles. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Finally, the “cake” in this strain’s name may in fact refer to the thickly-caked coating of resin covering the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces.Lemon Cake asserts itself with a bright citrus odor, undercut by a tang that may remind some consumers of parent strain Cheese. There’s also an underlying musk, with undeniable notes of skunk. Grinding up the bud releases some skunky odors as well. When combusted, Lemon Cake burns with a somewhat acrid smoke that may be harsh on the lungs and sinuses, inducing coughing. On the exhale, this smoke may have a surprisingly herbal taste. Those smoking in public should keep in mind that this can be a very pungent bud -- after all, Skunk exists on both sides of its lineage. Although it’s billed as a sativa, Lemon Cake has surprisingly wide-ranging effects. The high takes effect quickly, conferring a surge of energy as users feel a prickling sensation around the eyes and temples. This buzzy sensation may also manifest as a jittery feeling in the arms and legs. Mentally, smokers will detect a rapid increase in freely-associative thought patterns. Such a cerebral mindset can serve as a good way to focus oj complex professional tasks or as a fun accompaniment to otherwise mundane activities like cleaning. That said, this head-focused high may be alarming or disorienting for some. In the right set and setting. Lemon Cake can be valuable for introspective solo time, provided that consumers veer away from excessive self-criticism. Some physical relaxation creeps in on the backend of the high, grounding any early mental effects and allowing users to sink into a mellow and stress-free mindset. In high enough doses, Lemon Cake may bring about intractable couchlock. Lemon Cake is recommended for use from the late afternoon through early evening when its slide from energy into relaxation can be fully appreciated.Medical cannabis may also find value in this strain’s versatile effects. Its early sense of focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on single tasks. It can also help patients with mild to moderate stress and depression to spend their time more mindfully and consciously. Physiologically speaking, the strain can relieve deep-seated aches and pains as well as more minor irritations like headaches. Because Lemon Cake’s onset is associated with intense cerebral thinking, those who are prone to panic should moderate their dosage accordingly and consume with caution.Seeds of Lemon Cake are available through several digital retailers. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to maintain and indica silhouette, growing short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to “top” their plants regularly by trimming away any broad fan leaves that might block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Lemon Cake flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October outdoors. It offers a yield of about 600 to 700 grams (or 21 to 25 ounces) of flower per plant. Finally, just as this strain can be a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow -- those looking to keep their indoor grow operations discreet should invest in measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.A flavorful and memorable bud for sativa lovers, Lemon Cake is great for both mellow and active pursuits, whether you’re toking alone or sharing with friends.\n"

        "description": "Bailey’s has made a name for itself as the premiere name in coffee-and-cream flavored intoxicants. Now, an indica stands to claim that title. Irish Cream was created by Mighty Irish Seeds, a group of breeders based in Ireland, a somewhat less common home base for cannabis cultivation. The strain is a back-cross of the company’s signature strain, Mighty Irish Hope. Besides a standout flavor, this bud offers a heavy, stony high that’s potent for newbies and veterans alike. Irish Cream’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 20%.Irish Cream impresses off the bat with medium to large buds. The flowers range in shape from roughly conical to almost spherical and, true to their indica lineage, adhere in a dense, solid bud structure. Irish Cream is also notable for its uniform coloring, appearing almost entirely forest green; there are relatively few hairy pistils winding their way through these coiled leaves and only a light dusting of trichomes.When properly cured, flowers of Irish Cream smell both fruity and sweet, with some light floral notes. On closer inspection, there’s also a dank, funky odor lurking underneath -- perhaps unsurprising considering that parent strain Mighty Irish Hope has some Skunk in its lineage. Meanwhile, breaking or grinding up these dense buds yields some nutty aromas. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, Irish Cream gives off a smooth, pleasant smoke that carries nutty and coffee flavors on the exhale.Irish Cream offers a creeper of a high, sometimes taking several minutes after users have savored its unique aroma to reveal its effects. Eventually, users may feel a weightiness that starts in the eyelids and then spreads down slowly through the neck. Muscular tension may evaporate and deep breathing may happen more easily. In addition to a relaxed body, smokers typically also feel a relaxation in their thoughts -- this strain’s vibes can eliminate the stress and aggravation of a long day of running the rat race. Many smokers may go so far as to shun outside stimuli, instead preferring to stretch out indoors as the pervasive feeling of body melt becomes stronger and stronger. Indeed, it may not take much for this bud to induce couchlock. Unfortunately for the conscientious smoker, Irish Cream is not prone to leave its users mentally acute; instead, this strain is better for enjoying down time with loved ones or for spacing out alone to some trippy music or films. In high enough doses, it can even lull consumers into a restful, intractable sleep. Despite its name, then, you may not want to pair this tasty bud with your morning coffee, as it’s liable to sap energy and motivation. Irish Cream is best suited to evening and nighttime consumption.Medical cannabis patients may also find use in Irish Cream’s sedative effects. Its potent body melt can relieve deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. The strain’s anti-inflammatory effects may also soothe minor irritations like headaches or nausea. Psychologically speaking, Irish Cream can temporarily improve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress, depression, and even anxiety. As noted, it can also work against stubborn cases of insomnia. Because this strain is not likely to bring about paranoid cerebral thinking, it may be a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Mighty Irish Seeds has made seeds of Irish Cream available for sale online. The strain is a hardy grow that may be forgiving on newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Irish Cream flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a modest yield of about 37 to 42 grams (or 1.3 to 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.With a lasting, sedative high and a full-bodied flavor, Irish Cream may make you wish that every day was St. Patrick’s. Just be wary of pairing this already-heavy strain with a sleep-inducing pint of Guinness.\n"

        "description": "A hybrid with built-in name recognition, Blueberry Diesel is of course a cross between Blueberry and Sour Diesel, two popular strains in their own right. This mellow bud is both mentally and physically relaxing; although it has a slight indica edge, there’s substantial mental stimulation to be found in the high as well. A great middle-of-the-road smoke, Blueberry Diesel’s THC content has been measured at between 13% and 23%.Blueberry Diesel establishes its bag appeal right away with big, chunky flowers. The buds adhere in a dense, indica-typical structure and have a tapered, almost conical shape. Leaves are a mossy green and are shot through with dark, rust-colored pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of Blueberry Diesel often have flashes of dark blue and indigo in their flowers -- these colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genes are stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, white trichomes cover these nugs, giving them a sticky and slightly moist texture when freshly trimmed.Unsurprisingly, blueberry is the most prominent that wafts up from these flowers in fruity and tangy waves. As astringent gasoline tang also comes through on closers inspection, thanks to the Diesel in the strain’s background. Grinding up the buds yields some dank and earthy notes. Surprisingly for a Diesel-inflected strain, Blueberry Diesel burns with a very smooth smoke when combusted. Nevertheless, this smoke leaves behind a fruity and somewhat sharp, acrid aftertaste. Notably, this bud’s blue hues are coincidental to its blueberry flavor -- while botanical color is determined by pigments, aroma is dictated by separate compounds called terpenes.Blueberry Diesel offers a creeping high that may only become apparent several minutes after users have savored its unique flavor. Initial effects can be detected as a tingle around the eyes and temples. Smokers may also develop a sudden interest in external stimuli, with bright colors and music taking on new, more intense dynamics. Although users may also become increasingly thoughtful, this mindset is characterized more by a rambling creativity than by any kind of analytical focus. As such, Blueberry Diesel may not be the best strain to smoke before delving into work. As the high wears on, physical relaxation tends to set in, pulverizing muscular tension and allowing deep breathing to happen more easily. In these later stages, this bud can be a great way to add a giddy kick to social gatherings; it can provoke conversation and camaraderie. A great way to kick back without being totally immobilized, Blueberry Diesel is best enjoyed during the afternoon or evening, when its sedation and slow waves of euphoria can be fully savored.Blueberry Diesel can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can stimulating hunger, helping to recover appetite for those who may have lost it to illness or to chemotherapy treatment. Its physical relaxation can also relieve pain, whether it’s incidental, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or lupus. Psychologically speaking, Blueberry Diesel can also temporarily take the edge off of stress and depression. Because its sativa onset is not particularly cerebral or intense, this strain may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Blueberry Diesel are available from several digital retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants can grow to between 4 and 6 feet tall; those cultivation indoors should take care to train this height early on through vigilant pruning. Those looking to bring out this bud’s blue and purple hues should also expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins. Blueberry Diesel flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors. It offers a yield of about 42 grams (or 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.This strain’s combination of heady effects and a rich, complex aroma make it a great all-purpose strain. If you break it out at a party, be sure to bring enough to share, as its fruity clouds are sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Blueberry Headband is a strain that seizes on some popular genetics to offer a well-balanced high. Developed by prolific breeders Emerald Triangle Seeds, creators of Emerald Jack and Cherry OG, this bud’s background is more complicated than its name implies -- rather than a simple cross between Blueberry and Headband, this strain is actually a cross between Blueberry, Emerald OG Kush, Cali Sour D, and Pre-98 Bubba Kush. The result is a deeply aromatic bud with serious bag appeal. Cannabis testing Analytical 360 has measured this strain’s potency at between 12% and 18%.Blueberry Headband impresses with chunky medium to large buds. These thick flowers hold together in a dense indica structure, with tightly-packed leaves. The leaves themselves are a vibrant shade of yellow-green and are threaded through with yellow to orange pistils. Translucent amber trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these dense nugs, accounting for the strain’s psychoactivity, as well as its honey-colored sheen.When properly cured, this strain’s Blueberry roots come through with a prominent tart and fruity scent. On closer inspection, there’s also a slight tang of citrus. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the sticky buds yields some woodsy notes of pine. When combusted, Blueberry Headband burns with a smooth, easily palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke has been said to taste like a combination of pine and lemon, not unlike some artificially-scented home cleaning products. Finally, smokers should note that this bud can be a particularly pungent smoke; those looking to maintain discretion should take the needed precautions.The high from Blueberry Headband takes hold quickly, surprising smokers with a constricted sensation around the eyes and temples (the “headband” in its name may actually reference this feeling, rather than staple strain Headband). Users may also detect an uptick in mental energy, although although the bud’s physical relaxation keeps this cerebral kick from becoming overstimulating. Early stages of the high may be marked by altered perceptions such as visual distortion or a trippy sense of time dilation -- atmospheric music or movies can be a good way to enhance this psychedelic edge. As smokers acclimate to Blueberry Headband’s vibe, they feel a deep sense of physical and mental calm. This balanced feeling can be a great way to enjoy recreational activities like hiking or lounging on the beach. It can also be an effective work aid, whether you need to accomplish analytical tasks or more creative work. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Blueberry Headband’s relaxation slips into sedation. The high is said to be particularly long-lasting, even for cannabis veterans. This bud is a good option for waking-and-baking or for enjoying in the afternoon to early evening; it can leave smokers wired if consumed before bed.Blueberry Headband may also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to bring about mental focus while sustaining physical relaxation can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. It may also soothe aches and pains, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory effects can relieve everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Finally, Blueberry Headband can temporarily blunt the symptoms of stress and depression, helping the afflicted to spend their time more consciously and presently. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume with cautions due to this strain’s slightly cerebral onset.Emerald Triangle has made seeds of Blueberry Headband available for sale online; consumers should be aware that some other breeders have produced less complex hybrids, also named Blueberry Headband. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Those growing indoors should keep the plants’ height manageable by trimming and pruning early in the vegetative stage. Blueberry Headband flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, just as this is a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow -- growers looking to keep their indoor operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.As enjoyable for social use as it is when shared with friends, Blueberry Headband’s versatility makes it a good all-purpose hybrid. Its fruity, crowd-pleasing aroma is sure to make it popular at parties.\n"

        "description": "Blueberry and Haze are two strains that have gained renown for their potency and unusual flavor profiles. No surprise, then, that this cross between the two is a popular hybrid in its own right. Blueberry Haze leans sativa, but its body high can prove heavy and almost incapacitating if the bud is consumed in larger quantities. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has consistently found the strain to have between 14% and 23% THC, averaging out at about 16%.When properly trimmed, Blueberry Haze’s flowers are small to medium in size, with a clustered, popcorn-like appearance. The buds have the dense structure typically associated with indicas, with the small leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green, twisted through with hairy orange pistils. An even coating of translucent white trichomes covers the flowers, giving them a silvery cast and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, these flowers give off the overwhelming aroma of blueberries, sweet and slightly tart. Lurking underneath is the spicy, herbal aroma -- almost reminiscent of tea -- that Haze fans will find familiar. This spicy character is intensified when the bud is ground up or broken open. When combusted, Blueberry Haze burns with a smooth palatable smoke. On the exhale, the smoke tastes fruity and somewhat sweet. Enjoy this unique bud in a clean pipe or a joint to fully savor its taste.Blueberry Haze hits the smoker quickly. The most obvious effect is an increase in cerebral stimulation, with thought flowing from one to the next in rapid, free association. This kind of recursive thinking can lead to paranoia for some. In the right set and setting though, Blueberry Haze’s jolt to the head can be buzzy and motivational. It can provide the energy needed to engage in anything from cleaning the house to getting some exercise. The strain’s focused, analytical mindset can also be an aid in accomplishing work, whether it’s task-based, analytical, or free-flowing and creative. As the high wears on, a gradual body high sets in and may deepen if dosage is increased. In large enough amounts, Blueberry Haze can even lull users into a deep and restful sleep. If you find yourself relatively energetic, though, you may want to take advantage of this strain’s meld of mental and physical effects, which can serve as a powerful aphrodisiac. Blueberry Haze is a great choice for social use or for some much needed “me time.” Because of its taper down into sedation, this strain is recommended for use during the late afternoon to early evening.Medical cannabis patients may also find value in Blueberry Haze’s versatile effects. It can help those suffering from mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more presently and mindfully. The bud’s physical relaxation can also soothe all kinds of deep-seated aches and pains, both temporary and chronic, Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory effects can soothe minor irritations like nausea and headaches. As noted, this strain can work against insomnia by bringing on heavy and lasting sleep. Because its early sativa effects are often intense, Blueberry Haze is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, seeds of Blueberry Haze are readily available online. This bud may be a difficult grow for newcomers to cultivation, though. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight and temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As with many predominantly sativa strains, this bud can also grow very tall; indoor growers should be sure to cut back their plants early on in order to train them to fit in limited space. Blueberry Haze flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is known to offers an average yield. After the long and laborious growing process, growers should also take the time to properly cure their harvested buds to preserve their flavor and psychoactivity.A bold but soothing strain, Blueberry Haze is a must-try for indica and sativa lovers alike. It’s further proof that two powerhouse strains can be bred to yield something equally appealing.\n"

        "description": "Chocolate Chunk is an indica that doesn’t sacrifice potency for the sake of flavor. This tasty bud has a toasted, dessert-like aromatic profile alongside strong, body-centered psychoactivity. Created by TH Seeds -- also the purveyors of strains like MK Ultra and A-Train, it’s derived from Afghani indica landrace genetics. Save this bud for a lazy night on the couch, as it’s likely to deliver a knockout punch of sedation. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Chocolate Chunk’s potency at between 10% and 22% THC.Chocolate Chunk’s flowers are small to medium in size and have the chunky, dense look you’d expect from a pure indica. These buds have an almost conical shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. The tightly-coiled leaves are a mossy green and are twisted through with curly orange to yellow hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Amber trichomes round out the flowers, giving them a yellowish tint and a very sticky texture.Taking one whiff, it’s clear that Chocolate Chunk has inherited its parent strain’s rich aroma. When properly cured, flowers are earthy and dank, with a scent somewhat redolent of damp soil. The distinct smell of chocolate also lurky underneath, accented by some notes of coffee. Grinding up or breaking open the buds yields more of Afghani’s hashy, slightly piney odor. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, Chocolate Chunk’s smoke can be harsh and acrid, stinging the eyes and sinuses. This smoke tastes chocolatey and nutty on the exhale.Chocolate Chunk hits surprisingly quickly for an indica. Shortly after savoring the bud’s rich flavor profile, smokers are hit with a strong feeling of physical relaxation, starting in the neck and head and spreading down through the core. Aches and pains as well as musuclar tensions are quickly eased. Chocolate Chunk can also turn down the volume on any lingering mental static, blunting smokers’ worries and anxieties with the force of its sedation. Because it does little to stimulate cerebral energy, this strain may not be the best choice for getting a pile of work done. Instead, take a load off and enjoy the distorted sensory perception that Chocolate Chunk provides with a psychedelic movie or some atmospheric music. As the high wears on, the heavy feeling of sedation may intensify, and many may find themselves melting into their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background; users shouldn’t plan on having a busy agenda after consuming this bud. A solid way to unwind after a long day or week or work, Chocolate Chunk is as enjoyable alone as it is when shared with like-minded friends. Clearly, this strain is most appropriate for nighttime use.Chocolate Chunk’s strong, almost narcotic sedation may also have some medical applications. In high enough doses, it can work against insomnia, lulling users into a deep, fulfilling sleep. It can also soothe pain, whether temporary or chronic. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory properties may take care of everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. Psychologically speaking, Chocolate Chunk may temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Because it is unlikely to bring about intense, recursive patterns of thinking, this strain may be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Breeders TH Seeds have made seeds of Chocolate Chunk available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The characteristically indica plants tend to grow short and bushy -- growers should periodically “top” their crops by trimming away any large fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Chocolate Chunk flowers within a short 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers only a modest yield of about 32 to 37 grams (or 1 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Chocolate Chunk is more of a luxurious dessert-time treat than a casual, mid-day smoke. Save this rich and potent strain for a night indoors and get to lounging.\n"

        "description": "Green Goddess may be a popular creamy salad dressing, but it’s also the name of a potent sativa-dominant hybrid. Although it’s derived from the famously pungent Skunk #1, Green Goddess has a floral and fruity aromatic profile. This vibrantly-colored bud offers a relaxing high that doesn’t necessarily rule out productivity and mental simulation. The strain’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 12% and 20% THC.The look of Green Goddess’ flowers certainly justifies the strain’s lofty name. These buds are medium to large in size and have a markedly indica bud structure, clinging together in dense, solid chunk. They range in shape from slightly tapered and cylindrical to almost spherical. As you might expect, the tightly-packed leaves contain several striking shades, ranging from a dark forest green to a bright spring green. The buds are also twisted through with hairy, dark brown pistils. Finally, an even coating of cloudy, translucent trichomes gives these flowers a white sheen and a very sticky texture, making them difficult to break up without the use of a grinder.On initial inspection, flowers of Green Goddess have a pleasant floral aroma. This scent is undercut by some slightly dank, kushy odors, likely passed on from the strain’s Skunk parent. On closer examination, there are also some citrusy notes of lemon and grapefruit. Green Goddess tastes light and gives off a smooth, easy smoke when combusted. On the exhale, this smoke tastes of citrus with just a faint hint of the skunky odor that makes the strain’s ancestor so famous.Users begin to feel this strain’s effects relatively quickly. Green Goddess confers a slight pressure around the front of the face. At the same time, it flexes smokers’ cerebral capacity, helping to either stimulate their free-associative thinking or zone in their focus on a single task; this can be a great way to accomplish work, whether it’s creative or more rigid and analytical. Some consumers feel a burst of energy that may provide the motivation needed to leave the house for activities like exercise or running errands. However, if your agenda is geared more towards lounging than going outside, Green Goddess is great for socializing, as its buzzy vibes can encourage giddiness and conversation. Within some time, smokers may being to feel progressive waves of relaxation beginning in the neck and spreading down through the core and limbs. Mental and physical stress may evaporate, and any tension held in the muscles can begin to disappear. These mellow vibes on the strain’s backend can be great for unwinding alone with a favorite TV show or album. Because it tapers down from energy into relaxation, Green Goddess is best enjoyed during the afternoon or early evening.Green Goddess can have potential uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its ability to sustain focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to work thoroughly on single tasks. The strain’s generally mood-elevating properties may also temporarily relieve the acute symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Green Goddess can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Unfortunately, because the early stages of Green Goddess’ high are associated with intense cerebral thinking, it may not be the best choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No large commercial breeders have claimed responsibility for Green Goddess’ creation, and no seeds of the strain are available for sale online. As such, home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” There is little information available on best practices for cultivation of this specific strain, but we know that, like most hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid climates with daytime temperature between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Green Goddess’ sativa-leaning genetics also suggest a relatively long flowering time; some sources report that it may take as long as 13 weeks to fully mature.Although Green Goddess can be a great way to enhance a hike or a camping trip, you don’t have to be a hippie or a tree-hugger to appreciate its holistically relaxing vibes. Enjoy this strain alone or with a group of like-minded friends for a uniquely divine experience.\n"

        "description": "Hippie Crippler is a well-balanced hybrid that takes aim at one of its biggest traditional fanbases -- but you don’t have to be a hippie to be stunned by the force of this bud’s distorted, psychedelic energy. Hippie Crippler is a cross between popular hybrid AK-47 and fruity sativa Blue Satellite. Although this strain’s dank, funky aroma is an acquired taste for some, it is worth sampling for its long-lasting, spacey high. Its THC levels have been measured at between 15% and 22%.Flowers of Hippie Crippler are not particularly visually impressive, appearing only small to medium in size and clinging together in tight, popcorn-like clusters. The buds have a dense, indica-typical structure and the leaves are a light shade of spring green, filled with hairy brown pistils. Glassy amber trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces and crevices of these flowers, accounting for their potency and giving them a slightly yellowish sheen.What Hippie Crippler lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for with olfactory quality. Hippie Crippler’s aromatic profile is classically dank, cementing the strain’s association with hippie culture. When properly cured, these flowers have a strikingly acrid, earthy scent, similar to damp soil mixed with fermented compost. On closer inspection, there are also some spicy, incense-like odors; some consumers describe a whiff of that other hippie mainstay, patchouli. Meanwhile, grinding up the tight buds yields some peppery and piney notes. Despite its hashy flavors, Hippie Crippler gives off a surprisingly smooth and palatable smoke when burnt. This smoke has a hashy, piney taste on exhale, with a slightly fruity aftertaste.The high from this strain takes effect quickly, causing smokers to feel spacey and altered. This bud’s ability to distort perception may become apparent within minutes, with certain sights and sounds taking on new dimensions and intensity. This trippy, disorienting sensation can be sustained with the consumption of atmospheric music or visually-engaging movies or TV. More experienced smokers may acclimate to Hippie Crippler’s dreamlike sensations to accomplish some basic tasks like cleaning the house or sorting emails, but others may find themselves down for the count. By and large, the force of the strain’s psychoactivity is likely to keep users indoors, amused by the company of likeminded friends -- or by something as simple as a fidget spinner. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes increasingly likely, as does sudden sleep. Hippie Crippler is a great strain for social use, but can also be useful for unwinding alone after a long day or week of work. It’s also an ideal variety to save for a rainy day at home. Because of its sleepy, spacey vibes, Hippie Crippler is best consumer in circumstances that don’t demand productivity -- namely, weekend, early evening, or bedtime use.Hippie Crippler may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sedative body stone can be an effective means of pain relief, for both temporary and chronic conditions. The bud’s anti-inflammatory properties can also take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can blunt the stressors of the outside world, this strain may also temporarily take the edge off of some cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it is not usually associated with intense, cerebral thinking or paranoia, Hippie Crippler may be a good choice for users who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.With no seeds commercially available, home growers must rely on a trusted, reliable source in order to obtain clippings from healthy, mature plants of the strain; these clippings can be grown as genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information readily available on best cultivation practices specific to this strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climates. Hippie Crippler’s indica-like characteristics suggest short plants that can be easily fostered indoors. Its apparent indica genes also imply a relatively short flowering time.More likely to render you horizontal on your couch than out and about, Hippie Crippler is a great strain to keep on hand for mellow occasions. Be warned that it can be a very pungent smoke; those looking to keep their consumption under wraps should take any necessary precautions.\n"

        "description": "Jedi Kush is an indica that will awaken the powerful psychic knight within. This strain was devised by Cali Connections -- the creators of strains like Deadhead OG and Alien OG -- as a cross between knockout indica Death Star and SFV OG Kush. It offers a nuanced, mutli-layered high that, despite its indica genetics, is not too heavily. Although it may not give you the power of mind control, Jedi Kush is sure to add a psychedelic new dimension to your day. Cannabis testing laboratory Analytical 360 has consistently found samples of Jedi Kush to have between 15% and a whopping 30% THC, making it highly potent for both cannabis and veterans.Jedi Kush asserts its bag appeal right away, with its chunky medium to large flowers. These nuggets have an almost conical shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. They cling together in the dense, heavy bud structure typically associated with indicas. The leaves, tightly curled inward toward their central stems, are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with curly orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. A very high volume of cloudy white trichomes covers all surfaces of these flowers, giving them a snowy appearance and accounting for their psychoactivity.When properly cured, flowers of Jedi Kush carry the prominent scent of diesel fumes -- this aroma was likely passed on from parent strain Death Star, which has Sour Diesel in its background. On closer inspection, the buds also have a damp, earthy scent, somewhat like of moist soil after a rainstorm. Grinding up or breaking open these buds yields sharp, skunky notes. When combusted, Jedi Kush burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may sting the palate and sinuses, causing coughing and watery eyes. Those looking to keep their consumption discreet may want to take a few precautions, as this strain can be a particularly pungent smoke.Jedi Kush offers a slow, creeping high. It may be several minutes after smokers have enjoyed its complex flavor combination before they begin to feel a gradual warping of their sensory perception. Sights and sounds may take on a new dimension; users also describe a powerful sense of time dilation. Once consumers acclimate, though, they can point this high in any direction they might want. It can inspire creativity as well as deep analysis for work on problem-oriented tasks. Alternatively, Jedi Kush can be great for spacing out and daydreaming while enjoying one’s surroundings. In addition to these cerebral vibes, a slight, tingling body high leaves smokers with newfound energy and motivation -- this combination of mental and physical effects is great for activities that involve both, like exercise, dancing, and even sex. Although it’s largely not sleepy, increasing dosage can eventually bring about couchlock. Jedi Kush may be one of the few indica strains that’s as appropriate for evening use as it is for waking-and-baking. Jedi Kush’s versatile effects may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its subtle physical relaxation can soothe mild aches and pains, as well as irritations like headaches and nausea. The strain’s tendency to improve mood may also temporarily improve symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. In high enough doses, Jedi Kush may even lull insomniacs into a deep and fulfilling sleep. Because it may bring about some intense cerebral effects, patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume this bud with caution.Cali Connection has made seeds of Jedi Kush available for sale online. A forgiving grow for newcomers to cultivation, the strain has a higher than average natural resistance to mold and mildew. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Jedi Kush flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, it can be a particularly pungent grow -- those cultivating indoors may want to invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.A complex indica, Jedi Kush can be a great way to enhance everything from hiking to board games. For a truly forceful experience, pair it with Skywalker OG or Yoda OG\n"

        "description": "Kona Gold is a bold sativa with long-lasting effects, born from potent Hawaiian landrace genetics. Hawaii has a long history of cannabis cultivation and it shows in this strain’s powerful aroma and distinctly-shaped flowers. Kona Gold has a modest THC content that has been measured at between 7% and 15%, making it appropriate for newcomers to cannabis. Even for vets, though, this purely sativa strain can help experienced smokers maintain focus, energy, and optimism.Kona Gold can be recognized by its distinctly sativa structure -- more wispy than bud-like, these flowers grow in elongated formations along their branches. The leaves appear wispy and loose and can easily be torn away from their central stems. These leaves are a mossy shade of green and are twisted through with fewer than average pistils, which range in color from yellow to pale orange. Finally, Kona Gold’s blossoms are covered in translucent white trichomes, giving them a snow appearance and making them difficult to break up without a quality grinder on hand.When properly cured, Kona Gold’s flowers are unique in their lack of dank or skunky pungency. Instead, these buds smell surprisingly fresh and floral. There are also some fruity, tropical-tinged hints of pineapple and mango. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Kona Gold gives off a surprisingly smooth smoke that’s generally easily tolerated. This smoke tastes floral and fruity on the exhale.Kona Gold hits quickly, conferring a pressure and tightness around the eyelids and temples. This feeling is accompanied by an uptick in cerebral thinking -- smokers may notice their thoughts jumping from one the next, in free association. Although some may find this head-focused experience disorienting or overwhelming, in the right set and setting, it can be a great way to enhance focus on a variety of tasks. Kona Gold can help stimulate creativity in freeform brainstorm situations. Alternatively, it may help users to concentrate on finding analytical solutions to problem-oriented work. Kona Gold can also provide an illuminating backdrop for otherwise mundane activities like cleaning the house or running errands. If you’re in a more athletic mood, try toking on some of this strain before going on a run or a hike. Overall, Kona Gold can inspire positivity, making any prior stressors seem temporary or irrelevant. This may help elevate a smoker’s mood on a particularly stressful day. With few discernible physical effects, Kona Gold is not at all likely to leave users couchlocked or drowsy.Because of its buzzy, active properties, this strain is better suited to daytime than to evening use; if consumed before bed, it’s likely to keep smokers awake and wired.Kona Gold may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its strong sense of focus can be a good way for those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. Similarly, its immediacy and alertness may help those with stress and depression to spend their time more presently and consciously. Physiologically speaking, Kona Gold’s anti-inflammatory properties may soothe minor irritations like nausea and headaches. Patients who are prone to panic should consume this strain with caution -- although its THC content is relatively low, it may bring about recursive thinking and paranoia.Although it has history of cultivation within Hawaii, seeds of Kona Gold are not available for sale online. Instead, hopeful home growers will need to seek out a reliable source of clippings for mature plants of the strain which can be grown as genetically-identical “clones.” Kona Gold can be grown indoors or out; thanks to its hardy landrace genetics, it actually may fare much better than other strains if grown outdoors, where it may have a natural resistance to adverse conditions. This bud’s sativa background suggests that its plants may grow very tall. As such, those growing indoors should be sure to trim back their crops early on in order to train them to fit in limited indoor spaces.Somewhat difficult to come by outside of Hawaii, Kona Gold should be snatched up if spotted on dispensary shelves. Its crowd-pleasing aroma and purely head-focused high can be a great treat to break out at parties.\n"

        "description": "Silver Surfer is a sativa-dominant hybrid with all the buzzy energy you could possibly need to power through your day. This strain is a cross between award-winning Super Silver Haze and the uber-popular Blue Dream. With a dank and earthy aroma alongside its active, productive mindset, this strain is a must-try for both sativa and hybrid lovers. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured Silver Surfer’s potency at between 12% and an impressive 26% THC.Silver Surfer establishes its bag appeal right away with flowers that show off a hybridized structure: like indicas, they are dense and tightly-packed, but like sativas, they have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. The leaves are a patchwork of mossy green, shot through with dark orange to red pistils. Some phenotypes of this strain also have faint hints of light purple in their leaves; these hues are due to pigments called anthocyanins which trigger shades of blue and purple when agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, much like White Widow and this bud’s parents strain Super Silver Haze, Silver Surfer is named for the high volume of translucent trichomes that cover its leaves and gives them a silvery sheen.When properly cured, flowers of Silver Surfer have a musky, earthy scent, similar to that of damp soil. On closer inspection, the acrid tang of cheese is also present, giving the buds a sharp edge. This strain seems to have little of the fruitiness of its parent, Blue Dream; instead, Silver Surfer’s only sweetness comes through as a kind of sour-sweet, fermented smell when buds are ground up or broken apart. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Silver Surfer burns with a harsh smoke that may tickle the palate or sinuses and trigger a coughing fit.Silver Surfer takes effect quickly, launching smokers into a new plane of consciousness. Sudden, inexplicable euphoria may set in, elevating the user’s mood and energy levels. Fast-paced, free-associative thinking may also take hold, with ideas and even speech jumping around in rapid succession. To be sure, this kind of “mindrace” can be disorienting for those who are unfamiliar with the sensation. In the right set and setting, though, Silver Surfer’s buzz can be put to use as a tool for work. It can allow smokers to maintain focus on work, whether that work consists of creative projects or of more rigorous, analytical tasks. Alternatively, Silver Surfer can be a great way to enjoy a trip to the gym or a long walk outdoors. It can even help add some spice to otherwise boring activities like cleaning the house. As the high wears on, some slight indica relaxation can creep in, pulling users back down to earth. In its later stages, Silver Surfer can be enjoyed for its psychedelic sensory distortion -- put on a spacey album or a trippy movie and let the outside world recede into the background. Because it is more stimulating than sedative, Silver Surfer is best enjoyed as a wake-and-bake bud or as an afternoon treat; if consumed before bed, it’s likely to keep users awake and wired.Silver Surfer may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its tendency to induce focus and concentration can help those with attention deficit disorders to accomplish large amounts of work more quickly than they otherwise might. Its mood-altering effects can also temporarily banish some of the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically, Silver Surfer’s anti-inflammatory properties can soothe minor annoyances like headaches and nausea. Because its high is associated with the kind of recursive thinking patterns that can lead to paranoia, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.No large, commercial-scale breeders have taken responsibility for creation of Silver Surfer and none have made seeds of the strain available online. As such, home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers looking to bring out Silver Surfer’s eye-catching lavender patches should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average, just before flowering begins.Use Silver Surfer to fly through your daily agenda with productivity and confidence. The strain can also be a fun smoke at parties -- but if you break it out in public, be prepared for its woodsy and earthy aroma to turn a few heads.\n"

        "description": "Lemon Haze is a very popular sativa-dominant hybrid that derives both its potency and its powerful aroma from two prestigious parents: it is a cross between sativa hybrid Silver Haze and pungent Lemon Skunk. With a memorable citrus flavor profile and a long-lasting, well-balanced high to boot, this bud is an asset to indica and sativa fans alike. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 ranks Lemon Haze’s psychoactivity at between 12% and a staggering 25%.Flowers of Lemon Haze impress with a distinct shape and texture. These buds are medium to large in size and adhere in roughly spherical chunks. Although the leaves are densely packed, they have a somewhat ragged and fluffy appearance. These fluffy leaves are a mossy shade of green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Amber trichomes cover these buds, giving them a slightly yellow glow and accounting for their high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Lemon Haze carries a strong citrus aroma; the tang of lemon is the predominant scent. Hanging out underneath is a spicy herbal kick that fans of parent strain Haze will almost certainly recognize. Surprisingly, this strain has little of the acrid funk that characterizes its other parent, Lemon Skunk. When combusted, Lemon Haze burns with a smooth and easily ingested smoke. This smoke tastes refreshingly herbal on the exhale, with some lingering lemon notes.Lemon Haze is said to offer a creeping high that may require several minutes before fully revealing its effects. At first, smokers may pick up on a change in their perception of external stimuli, with certain sights or sounds taking on a psychedelic new dimension. This sensory distortion is accompanied by a sudden improvement in mood, as any stressors take a backseat to this bud’s positive mindset. An increase in cerebral activity may lead to stimulating conversation; this strain may also inspire creativity for those who are so inclined. In addition to these emotionally uplifting effects, Lemon Haze tends to provide the motivation needed to get up and plow through tasks like cleaning the house or running errands. A strong body stone eventually emerges and becomes more pronounced as the high wears on. This combination of mental and physical effects can be a great way to appreciate activities that involve both body and mind, like exercise and, notably, sex. As dosage is increased, smokers may lose their thoughtful, cerebral edge, becoming more spacey and disconnected from their surroundings. On its backend, Lemon Haze will leave you content to melt into the couch and let your mind wander. Because of its energetic onset, this strain is best enjoyed for waking-and-baking or as an afternoon treat; if consumed at night, it’s likely to leave users wired and hyper.Lemon Haze may have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its positive mental effects can temporarily distract from the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. The strain’s early sense of focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on single tasks. Physically speaking, this bud can help relieve pain, whether it’s temporary or chronic and nerve-related. Although Lemon Haze’s cerebral effects aren’t usually regarded as overly intense, those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC may want to consume this sativa with caution.Several different commercial breeders have made seeds of Lemon Haze available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Those growing indoors should keep this plant’s height in check by trimming back and pruning branches early in the vegetative stage. Lemon Haze flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It offers a modest yield of about 40 to 44 grams (or 1.4 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Lemon Haze is an ideal all-purpose strain with a pleasant and refreshing aroma. It’s as enjoyable when shared with friends as its when savored alone -- if you do break it out around others though, bring enough to share, as its unique aroma is bound to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Enigma is a potent indica-dominant hybrid with a name that accurately describes its dreamy, moody effects. Technically, though, this bud is named for the German “Enigma” code cracked by famed scientist Alan Turing. The strain is part of Alphakronik Genes’ “Great Minds” series, which also includes Stephen Hawking Kush. There’s certainly nothing enigmatic about this strain’s background: it is a cross between Snowdawg and popular hybrid Blue Dream. It offers a deeply sedative high and a pungent, complex aroma. Enigma’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Flowers of Enigma tend to grab the consumer with their colorful, well-formed flowers. The buds are medium to large in size and adhere in a tapered, spadelike formation. They also have an unmistakably indica structure, with small, tightly-packed leaves that overlap and curl tightly inward. These leaves are a deeper shade of forest green and sometimes even show off flecks or wide swaths of purple; these latter hues are thanks to the influence of anthocyanins, pigments in the strain’s genetics that release blue and purple coloring when stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Enigma’s flowers are finished off by a coating of cloudy white trichomes that make them psychoactive and very sticky.The predominant scent that wafts up from flowers of Enigma is bright and lemony. There are also some dank, diesel-like notes hanging out underneath. Grinding up the thick buds tends to intensify the strain’s skunkiness. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Enigma burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke carries a combination of floral and citrus flavors on the exhale.Like many other mostly indica strains, Enigma’s high is a creeper. Several minutes after they’ve finished toking on these aromatic flowers, Enigma begin to exert a pressure around the user’s eyes. Once adjusted to these unfamiliar sensations, the smoker may experience some odd feelings of sensory distortion -- these can include an intensification of certain sights or sounds. Some users may also perceive some distortions in three-dimensional depth. Such psychedelic properties can be pushed even further by turning on some moody music or a trippy film. A short time into this bud’s high, a distinct euphoria sets in, banishing any stresses or preoccupations that may be plaguing the consumer. Such emotionally uplifting qualities can easily set the stage for social gatherings, where they can foster camaraderie and free-flowing conversations. Note that, although it’s part of Alphakronik’s Great Minds series, Enigma is not especially known for bringing about a focused, cerebral energy. As such, do not plan on plowing through a long to-do list or executing any complex, analytical tasks under this strain’s influence. As the high wears on, Enigma’s trademark indica relaxation kicks in, relieving any lingering muscular tension. In the right set and setting, this physical feeling of calm may be so strong as to make smokers feel as if they’re melting their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background. It should go without saying, then, that Enigma is best enjoying during the evening or nighttime.Enigma’s deeply therapeutic effects can have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sedation can temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. It may also dull physical pain, whether it’s due to a condition like arthritis or to more minor, everyday inflammation. For some, Enigma may also stoke hunger, making it a good appetite stimulant for those who have lost their appetite to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. In the right set and setting, this potent strain can even lull insomniacs into a deep, restful sleep. Because it is unlikely to bring about any sort of intense, recursive thinking, Enigma is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Seeds of Enigma are available from several digital retailers. Once obtained, it can be cultivated indoors or out -- although outdoor growing requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching, and can be easily accommodated indoors. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s purple hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are 10 to 15 degrees below average, just before flowering begins. Enigma flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a very high yield of flowers at maturity.This luxuriously relaxing strain is the perfect smoke for the end of a long day or week of work. Its eye-catching purple flowers also make a good conversation starter in social situations.\n"

        "description": "Citrus Sap is a sativa-dominant hybrid created as a joint venture between Crockett Family Farms, creators of Clementine, and the prolific DNA Genetics, who have given us flavorful strains like Lemon Skunk and Chocolope. Citrus Sap is a cross between powerful indica Gorilla Glue #4 and flavorful sativa Tangie. Despite its mostly sativa genetics, this strain tends to offer powerfully sedative effects. Besides leaving behind a lingering cloud of sweety, citrusy funk, Citrus Sap is liable to leave you couchlocked and daydreaming. Its THC content has been measured at between 17% and 24%.Flowers of Citrus Sap tend to have a conical shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. They range in size from small to medium and cling together in the dense, solid structure typically associated with indicas. The leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are threaded through with dark, rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). True to the “sap” in their name, flowers of Citrus Sap are covered in silvery resinous trichomes, giving them a frosty appearance.Like parent strain Tangie, Citrus Sap has a predominantly citrus smell, redolent of oranges and tangerines. Underlying this sharp aroma is a sweetness that verges on sour, with a slightly rank, fermented edge. On closer inspection, these buds also carry the woodsy odor of pine. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields some slightly skunky notes. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, Tangie gives off a thick and lung-expanding smoke that may induce coughing or cause eyes to water. On the exhale, this bud’s flavors meld, as the smoke leaves behind the tastes of citrus-inflected pine sap.Citrus Sap offers a slow, creeping high that may only set in several minutes after smokers have savored its unique, rich flavor. Initial effects take the form of full-body relaxation, with tingling, soothing waves spreading from the neck down through the core and limbs. Citrus Sap also comes with a trippy sensation, as it distorts perception of external stimuli like sights and sounds. This psychedelic edge makes it a great accompaniment to spacey movies or music, as well as for lifted conversations with like-minded friends. Indeed, the bud’s effects can be very social, facilitating giddiness and camaraderie. Although Citrus Sap provides some mental stimulation, any cerebral activity takes the form of rambling, circuitous daydreaming rather than an intense, analytical mindset; smokers should not plan on accomplishing a mountain of work after enjoying this aromatic strain. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes more and more likely. Enjoy this strain as a way to unwind after a long day or week of work. Because of its mostly sleepy vibes, Citrus Sap is best enjoyed during the evening or late at night. Citrus Sap’s sedative effects can also have many uses for medical cannabis patients. It is known to induce the munchies, serving as an appetite stimulant for those who have lost their hunger drive to illness or to harsh treatments like chemotherapy. The strain can also soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Some anti-inflammatory properties may also relieve everyday irritations like nausea and headaches. Because it is not likely to bring about intense, recursive thinking, Citrus Sap is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Citrus Sap are available online from Crockett Family Farms. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime sunlight and temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. If grown indoors, this strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks and offers a higher than average yield of flowers. Finally, Citrus Sap can be a particularly pungent grow -- those cultivating indoors may want to maintain discretion by investing in odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.A rare sleepy sativa, Citrus Sap makes it mark with potent effects and a memorable scent. This bud is a good resource for kicking back alone or with friends. Its high resin content can also be valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

Extremely popular in the U.S. in the late 1960s and 1970s, this strain has become very rare, with some cannabis historians claiming that seeds or clones of the original landrace genotype no longer exist. Whether or not Colombian Gold is still around for consumption, it has been used to breed popular staples like Skunk #1. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 20%.Cured buds of Colombian Gold may be unfamiliar to consumers of commercially-grown indicas and hybrids. The flowers are small to medium in size and have a loose, leafy structure, characteristic of pure sativas -- cannabis connoisseurs may recognize the silhouettes of these ragged flowers as similar to Jamaican or Thai sativa landraces. The leaves are a pale spring green and are threaded through with bright orange pistils. These long, tapered buds are also very resinous: amber trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces, giving them the golden glow to which their name refers.When properly cured, Colombian Gold emits the pungent odor of skunk, accounting for the pungency of child strain Skunk #1. On closer inspection, the citric tang of lemon and lime is also at play. When burned, Colombian Gold has an earthy, hashy scent. Its smoke can be harsh and lung-expanding when inhaled and carries an herbal taste on the exhale. Finally, this strain can be a particularly pungent smoke; those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any necessary precautions.Users of this storied strain have described very potent cerebral effects. The high comes on slowly and remains heady for its duration; effects are said to last much longer than average.  Creativity and talkativeness are common, as smokers’ thoughts jump from one to the next in rapid free association. A general sense of well-being is also commonly reported, as any lingering environmental stressors tend to recede into the background. Colombian Gold’s powerfully analytical mindset can be especially valuable for powering through a to-do list, whether it’s mundane or intellectually demanding. Unlike many landrace sativas, Colombian Gold is said to provide all the benefits of cerebral thinking without the common disadvantages of paranoia or recursive thinking. This strain is not known for being physically soothing or sedative -- instead, it provides a burst of energy that can be put use via exercise or tasks like cleaning the house. This overall buzzy character makes Colombian Gold the quintessential wake-and-bake strain; it is not recommended for use at night, as its active energy can keep smokers wired and hyper before bed.Colombian Gold’s wide-ranging effects can also have value for medical cannabis patients. Its enduring sense of concentration can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. The strain’s mood-elevating properties can also temporarily improve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Colombian Gold may soothe deep-seated aches and pains and relieve minor, everyday irritations like nausea and headaches. Because of its strong cerebral nature, this bud is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Cultivation of Colombian Gold is complicated by its rarity. Although seeds are not widely available for sale online, home growers can obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to cultivate genetically identical “clones.” That said, those concerned with genetic integrity should investigate the authenticity of both clones and commercially-packaged seeds  of this strain. If true Colombian Gold is obtained, it is best grown outdoors in a consistently warm climate with partial humidity and daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants are very tall and branchy and can be particularly resistant to mold. Although the flowering period comes very late - plants are ready for harvest in late November - this strain offers a higher than average yield. Finally, just as it is a pungent smoke, Colombian Gold can be a pungent grow; those growing indoors can keep their operations under wraps by investing in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.With tourism to Colombia booming in recent years and medical marijuana legalized in the country in 2015, growers and landrace enthusiasts may yet hope for a re-discovery or re-engineering of this potent strain.\n"

        "description": "Deep Chunk is a pure indica with strong sedative properties. Though originally cultivated and stabilized in Northern California, it has its origins in potent Afghani landrace genetics. Deep Chunk is the brainchild of breeder Tom Hill, who has stabilized varieties like X18 and Pine Tar Kush. Deep Chunk has bag appeal to spare, with colorful, eye-catching flowers and a complex, crowd-pleasing aroma. All of this aesthetic appeal does not detract from the strain’s sleepy potency: its THC levels have been measured at between 11% and 20%.Flowers of Deep Chunk are true to their name, clinging together in dense, chunky formations. These buds have the solid structure typically associated with indicas, and the broad leaves curly tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves on these medium-sized buds are a dark, mossy green threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of Deep Chunk also boast shades of blue and purple in their leaves; these cool hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the bud’s genetics, which become activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a coating of silvery white trichomes covers the inner and outer of surfaces of these dense nuggets, making them very difficult to break up without the use of a grinder.When properly cured, Deep Chunk’s flower have a musky, earthy aroma, tinged by some toasted chocolate notes. Lurking underneath is also the rich, woodsy scent of pine. Meanwhile, grinding up these sticky buds emits a hashy, incense-like odor, likely passed on from Afghani, as well as an astringent chemical tang. When combusted, Deep Chunk burns with a harsh and acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and sinuses, triggering coughing. On the exhale, this smoke has an earthy taste with some surprising hints of fruit.Deep Chunk’s effects have a slow, creeping onset. Several minutes after enjoying its rich and flavorful smoke, users may begin to feel a pressure around the eyes and temples. This light throbbing soon gives way to relaxation, as a tingle spreads down from the neck and through the core. While some may find this strong, almost dissociative feeling of physical relaxation overwhelming, in the right set and setting, it can be all that’s needed to unwind. Deep Chunk may lead to a trippy mindset in which certain sights and sounds take on a more intense dimension than they otherwise might. Many smokers also report a powerful sense of time dilation. This spacey edge can be a great way to enjoy psychedelic movies and music. Alternatively, this strain can be a great way to break the ice and mellow out with like-minded friends in social situations. If you consume Deep Chunk, don’t plan on accomplishing much; as the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes much more likely, allowing users to melt into their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background. Because of its mostly sedative, spaced-out vibes, Deep Chunk is more appropriate for evening and nighttime than for daytime and afternoon use.Deep Chunk’s potent effects can also have applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sedation has the ability to temporarily numb the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Additionally, it can act as an effective analgesic for deep-seated aches and pains as well as minor irritations like headaches and nausea. In high enough doses, Deep Chunk can lure even insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because it does not bring about intense, recursive thinking, this strain is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Breeder Tom Hill has made limited quantities of Deep Chunk’s seeds available for sale online. Alternatively, home growers can obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. It can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches; growers should regularly prune away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves in order to encourage the growth of flowering nodes on lower branches. Deep Chunk flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in September when grown outdoors. It rewards patient growers with a high yield of flowers.Somewhat difficult to come by, Deep Chunk is worth snatching up if spotted on dispensary shelves for its luxuriously sleepy properties.\n"

        "description": "The creators of Dog Shit were upfront in naming this unpleasantly pungent strain -- it really does smell like something you might accidentally step in. Dog shit is a patchwork of cannabis genetics that includes landrace strains like Colombian Gold, Cambodian, Afghani, and the rare Purple Zacatecas from Mexico. Beyond the simple novelty of its odor, Dog Shit offers strong, well-balanced effects that will appeal to cannabis novices and veterans alike. The strain’s THC level has been measured at between 12% and an impressive 26%. Unlike some pieces of its namesake that you might find littering the sidewalk, buds of Dog Shit tend to be small, clinging together in popcorn-like formation. They range in shape from circular to roughly conical and adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. The leaves are a mossy green and have a slightly yellow tint -- this golden glow may be due to the high volume of amber-colored trichomes that cover the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces.Dog Shit’s buds slap consumers right away with their odor, which is said to be dank and earthy with a rank, fermented edge. Afghani imparts some hashy, incense-like notes, while Colombian Gold brings a strong skunkiness. Grinding up the buds boosts this acrid, skunky odor. Surprisingly, when combusted in a pipe or a joint, Dog Shit transforms, burning with a smooth and palatable smoke. This smoke tastes like and fruity with just a slight musky undertone on the exhale.The high from Dog Shit takes effect quickly, exerting a pressure around the eyes and cheeks. This odd sensation is met with a uptick in cerebral thinking, as smokers may sense their thoughts jumping from one to the next in rapid free association. Users may also feel a sudden surge of energy, enabling them to accomplish basic errands like cleaning the house. Alternatively, Dog Shit’s laser-like focus can be a great way to accomplish work, whether it’s creative and freewheeling or more task-based and analytical. In more laidback circumstances, this bud can simply distract from the stresses of the outside world, helping smokers to appreciate the moment. When shared with friends, Dog Shit can induce rambling conversation, as well as some giggles and giddiness. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, physical relaxation sets in and becomes progressively stronger. Although it’s not enough to pin smokers down to the closest couch, it can mellow out some of the strain’s soaring sativa energy.Dog Shit’s eventual blend of mental and physical effects makes it a great accompaniment to activities that involve both body and mind, including, but not limited to, exercise and dancing. This bud is also well suited to  a hike or a camping trip in the great outdoors, where its odor can easily dissipate. Enjoy Dog Shit in the daytime to early evening; if toking right before bed, you’re liable to be wired and hyper.Dog Shit can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its cerebral onset can help those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus on a single task. The bud’s mood-altering effects may also help those suffering from stress and depression to spend their time more consciously and mindfully. Physiologically speaking, this strain may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic; its anti-inflammatory properties may also relieve everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can bring about fairly strong patterns of recursive thinking, Dog Shit is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No breeders have claimed responsibility for creating this provocatively-named strain, and none have made seeds available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or outdoors in a humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Perhaps due to its sturdy landrace genetics, this strain is said to be an easy grow, resistant to adverse conditions like mold and temperature variations. Like a whoopie cushion or a hand buzzer, Dog Shit is in part a novelty strain that can be fun to share at parties. If they’re able to withstand its pungency, your companions are sure to enjoy this strain’s middle-of-the-road effects.\n"

        "description": "Despite its name, Early Girl is not a strain to savor first thing in the morning. Created by Sensi Seeds, the breeders of strains like Super Skunk and Jack Flash, this indica-dominant hybrid is a cross between several landraces: indica Afghani and South Asian varieties and a Mexican sativa. Early Girl offers physically relaxing effects without overpowering consumers or sending them into a veritable coma. The strain’s pleasant, refreshing aroma and subtle effects make it a great all-purpose bud. Its THC content has been measured at between 12% and 20%.Early Girl has incredibly dense buds, as is typical of mostly indica strains. These hard, solid nuggets are small to medium in size and cling together in clustered, popcorn-like formations. The leaves, which curl tightly inward toward their central stems, are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with dark orange hairs (which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, a light dusting of translucent white trichomes covers the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces, giving them a sticky texture and making them hard to break up by hand.When properly cured, Early Girl bursts with sweet and earthy aromas. The predominant scent is musky and dank, redolent of damp soil. Hanging out underneath is the unmistakable smell of fresh lemon. Meanwhile, grinding up these buds yields more hash and spice, a testament to the influence of pungent Afghani. Early Girl burns with a smooth and easy smoke and has a citrus taste on the exhale, accented by a lingering earthy, dank aftertaste.Early Girl offers a creeper of a high that may take several minutes before revealing the extent of its effects. Eventually, smokers will detect a pressure around the eyes and temples that soon gives way to progressive waves of relaxation, spreading down through the neck and core. Smokers may also detect an amplification of their senses, with certain sights, sounds, and even tastes taking on unexpected new dimensions. Speaking of tastes, prepare for strong appetite stimulation, as Early Girl is said to be particularly prone to bringing on the munchies. Despite its primarily indica characteristics and fast-acting body stone, Early Girl is not without some cerebral effects. Users can feel an uptick in freely-associative thought, although this sensation is nothing like the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can come with stronger sativas. While not powerful enough to sustain concentration on complicated tasks, this mental energy is great for inspiring free-flowing conversation among like-minded friends. As dosage is increased, drowsiness and couchlock may set in. As such, Early Girl is a great way to unwind after a long day or week of work. Because of its mostly sleepy vibes, it’s recommended for use at night.Early Girl’s sedative properties can have many applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can be an effective painkiller, whether the pain is temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or lupus. Its mood-boosting effects can also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because Early Girl does not often lead to paranoid patterns of thinking, it can be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately for home growers, Sensi sells seeds of Early Girl online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain is said to be an easy grow for newcomers to cultivation, as it is resilient in the face of adverse growing conditions. Plants tend to grow short and bushy, and it is recommended that growers “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Early Girl flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early September when grown outdoors.A pleasantly-flavored strain with calming -- but not overwhelming -- effects, Early Girl is a no-brainer for indica fans. It’s as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared with friends.\n"

        "description": "Game Changer is an indica-dominant hybrid that offers as much potency as it does bag appeal. A cross between two complex strains, Purple Dragon and a Thai landrace variety called Green Thai, Game Changer has inherited its parent strains’ visual and olfactory appeal. With eye-catching flowers and a rich, surprising aroma, Game Changer’s dynamic, well-balanced high is icing on the cake. This strain’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 18% and a whopping 29%.Game Changer’s flowers impress right away with medium to large-sized nuggets that adhere in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. These buds tend to have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape, like miniature cypress trees. The tightly-packed leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are threaded through with hairy orange pistils. More often than not, phenotypes of the strain boast patches of purple and dark blue in their leaves; these hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics which become activated when cold weather sets in during the growing process. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the buds accounting for their psychoactivity and giving them a very resinous texture.When properly cured, buds of Game Changer have a distinctly tropical aroma, with hints of berry and grape. Hanging out underneath is a light, vaguely floral scent. Some consumers also point to a cheesy, tangy funk, possibly passed on from Purple Dragon. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, this strain burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may induce coughing. This smoke tastes floral and fruity on the exhale. Notably, any grape flavors are coincidental to the strain’s purple coloring -- while its color is determined by pigmentation, its taste is determined by different compounds called terpenes.Game Changer offers a creeper of high that may take several minutes after smokers have finished toking to reveal its effects. Initial effects can be detected as a tingle that begins in the face and is soon evident in the core and extremities as well. This strange sensation blooms into full-body relaxation, inspiring many to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings. Game Changer’s high is notable in that its mental stimulation sets in around the same time as its physical relaxation. A cerebral, free-associative mindset takes hold and smokers may find their thoughts jumping from one to the next. This stimulation can lend itself to spirited conversation in social situations. It can also bring about creativity, making it good for brainstorming in preparation for open-ended, creative projects. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes increasingly likely. Any earlier cerebral energy becomes more spacey, making Game Changer a good way to enjoy trippy movies and TV or simply to spend a night in unwinding. Because of its taper down from stimulation into relaxation, this strain is recommended for use in the late afternoon to early evening.When used in a medical context, this strain really is a game changer. Its mood elevating properties can help temporarily improve the symptoms of stress and depression. Its early sativa focus can be an aid to patients with attention deficit disorders. Meanwhile, Game Changer’s physical sedation may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Patients who are prone to anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC may want to consume this bud with caution, as its intense, recursive patterns of thinking can lead to paranoia.No commercial breeders have claimed responsibility for creating Game Changer and none have made seeds available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Game Changer has a somewhat hybridized growth pattern -- while its plants have a short and bushy indica silhouette, its sativa side demands a long flowering period of about 10 to 11 weeks. Growers who are looking to bring out the strain’s vibrant purple hues should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins.With a powerful, long-lasting high and a complex flavor profile, Game Changer is a must-try for both indica and sativa lovers. It’s also a great choice for newcomers to cannabis cultivations, as its hardy plants are resistant to adverse growing conditions.\n"

The strain that bears its name is no different -- it’s a cross between staple sativa Sour Diesel and award-winning indica Sensi Star. Hong Kong has a memorable aroma, with shades of citrus and gasoline, as well as an uplifting and long-lasting high. With a slight sativa edge, this bud is assured to provide the necessary boost to power through a busy day. Its THC has been measured at between 18% and 25%.The size of Hong Kong’s buds isn’t particularly impressive, as they appear small and popcorn-like, even when properly trimmed. The flowers have the dense, solid bud structure often associated with predominantly indica strains. The vivid color palette of these buds makes them stand out, though -- the leaves are an eye-catching patchwork of mossy green and deep purple, twisted through with vibrant orange pistils. Any purple shades are the result of pigments called anthocyanins that become activated due to cold temperatures in the growing process. Trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these buds, giving them a frosty appearance and a resinous texture.Floating on top of Hong Kong’s bouquet is a sweet, fruity odor with definite citrus overtones -- users compare this scent to orange or grapefruit. On closer inspection, Sour Diesel’s influence becomes obvious, with sweet and skunky gasoline-like fumes wafting up from the cured buds. Meanwhile, grinding up these flowers yields some subtle hash and spice. When burnt, the strain gives off a harsh smoke that may induce coughing for some. On the exhale, the smoke tastes like an unusual combination of diesel and citrus. Anyone enjoying this strain in public should take the necessary precautions, as Hong Kong can be a particularly pungent smoke Hong Kong’s effects set in quickly, launching smokers into new heights of perception and emotional well-being. What begins as a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples soon blooms into an increase in cerebral thinking. Thoughts may flow in a freely-associative manner, allowing users to transcend their surroundings and overcome any prior negative mood. Rather than becoming disorienting and spacey, though, Hong Kong allows its consumers to keep their feet planted firmly on the ground, able to interact and maintain focus in public. It’s a great strain for doing work, whether it’s creative or more rigid and analytical. As time passes or as dosage is increased, this bud’s indica side takes over, conferring a weighty feeling in the core and limbs. Breathing may happen more deeply and easily as the outside world recedes into the background. On its backend, Hong Kong is a good way to unwind after a long day. In social settings, its relaxed vibe can allow for free-flowing conversation with like-minded friends. This strain is best enjoyed during the afternoon or early evening; if consumed before bed, it may keep smokers awake and wired.Hong Kong’s far-reaching effects can also have applications for medical cannabis patients. Its early sense of focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on a single topic. Its physically relaxing effects can also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, while its anti-inflammatory properties can numb everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. In high enough doses, it can even lull insomniacs into a deep, fulfilling sleep. Because its onset is associated with intense cerebral thinking, Hong Kong is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Hong Kong does not seem to be bred for its seed stock. As such, prospective home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” While there is little information available on specific best practices for growing this variety, we know that, like most hybrids, it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers looking to bring out Hong Kong’s purple bag appeal should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least ten to fifteen degrees below average.Supremely balanced, Hong Kong can take you through a full day with its journey from energy down to thorough relaxation.

        "description": "Los Angeles has its fair share of haters, but there’s no denying the appeal of this indica-dominant hybrid named in the city’s honor. LA OG is a cross between two powerhouse strains: LA Confidential and none other than staple indica OG Kush. With a fruity flavor that has surprisingly few traces of funkiness, this bud’s bag appeal is as obvious as its potency. A heavy hitter, LA OG is best enjoyed on a lazy day with nothing else to do. Its psychoactivity has been measured at between 12% and 24%.Flowers of LA OG are small to medium in size and have the tight, dense bud structure you might expect of an indica-leaning variety. The leaves on these globular buds are a pale, mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, a blanket of cloudy white trichomes covers the flowers’ outer surfaces and inner nooks and crannies, making them exceptionally sticky.When inspecting buds of LA OG, consumers may detect the distinct scent of grapes. Some herbal, almost floral fumes also waft up from the cured buds. There’s a bit of musk hanging underneath these bright aromas, and grinding up the flowers yields some subtle spice and pepper, as is common for strains in the Kush family. When burnt, LA OG gives off a smooth and agreeable smoke that tastes fruity and floral on the exhale. Notably, even though they’re grape-scented, these flowers are not typically purple; this is because the terpene compounds that determine the buds’ aroma do not have a corresponding effect on their color.LA OG’s high is something of a creeper, taking as much as 20 minutes before beginning to exert a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. This weightiness soon spreads to the rest of the body, especially in the limbs. The temptation to take a load off on the closest comfortable couch may prove overwhelming for some. Users shouldn’t plan on a productive day after enjoying this bud. That said, the strain offers waves of euphoria that relax the body as much as they liberate the mind. Although it can inspire creativity with its open-minded vibe and trippy edge, the head high from LA OG is more meandering than laser-focused. In social settings, this can set the stage for an entertaining evening full of lounging and some free-flowing conversation. If smokers can muster the energy, LA OG is also said to serve as a potent aphrodisiac if the mood is right. As time passes or as dosage is increased, this strain is liable to lay users out flat, causing them to melt into their surroundings as the outside world falls out of focus. Because of its mostly sleepy, sedative properties, this strain is most appropriate for evening or nighttime use.LA OG can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its powerful physical effects can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, as well as temporary cramps. The bud’s anti-inflammatory properties may also relieve irritations like headaches and nausea. Its tendency to provoke hunger may even be an effective appetite stimulant for patients who have lost their appetites to disease or to chemotherapy. Psychologically speaking, LA OG’s easygoing effects can temporarily take the edge off of stress, depression, and even anxiety. In high enough doses, the strain may lull insomniacs to sleep.Seeds of LA OG are not available for sale online -- instead, hopeful home growers should obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Although there is little information available on specific best practices for growing this strain, we know that it can be cultivated indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. The strain’s indica genetics imply short and bushy plants that should be regularly trimmed to get rid of ay broad, light-blocking fan leaves.\n"

Although this popular strain’s creator and genetics are shrouded in mystery, its appeal is obvious. With a clean, refreshing citrus taste, it can be a welcome alternative to some danker, kushier varieties. Lemon Drop’s clear-eyed psychoactivity makes it a great daytime smoke for cannabis veterans and newcomers alike. Its potency has been measured at between 12% and 23%.Flowers of Lemon Drop are impressively large and chunky and, despite offering a mostly sativa high, have the chunky, dense structure typically associated with indicas. These buds tend to have a distinctly spade-like shape, tapering down from a broad base to a pointed tip. The leaves are a dark shade of forest green. A high volume of orange and rust-colored pistils wind their way through the dense nuggets. Some translucent white trichomes cover these buds as well, giving them a slightly frosty appearance at a glance.When properly cured, Lemon Drop carries the unmistakable aroma of fresh lemon and lime. Underneath is a slightly musty odor, suggesting a possible connection to the OG family. Meanwhile, grinding up these buds yields some woodsy notes of pine. When combusted in a joint or a pipe, Lemon Drop burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes simultaneously sweet and tart on the exhale.The high from Lemon Drop hits fast, conferring a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. Many begin to notice the strain’s effect as it begins to work on their sense; it may intensify external stimuli, making certain sights or sounds seem notably more dynamic. Besides this strange distortion, Lemon Drop also triggers an increase in deep cerebral thinking; concentration is amplified and can help smokers concentrate on any work they may need to accomplish, whether it’s analytical or more creative and freewheeling. Lemon Drop can provide the energy needed to get up and go, which can be especially helpful when your agenda consists of a long list of boring errands. In more social settings, this strain’s buzzy effects can bring about a strong feeling of camaraderie and can keep conversations flowing. With very little of the weighty body stone that comes as a side effect of more indica-dominant strains, Lemon Drop is not at all likely to leaves its consumers couch-bound. For this reason, the strain is recommended for daytime use; if enjoyed at night, it’s likely to prevent sleep rather than to aid it. Finally, this bud’s effects are said last longer than average, even for experienced cannabis consumers.Lemon’s Drop’s upbeat effects may also have some utility for medical cannabis patients. Its euphoria can help to blunt the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. The strain’s lasting sense of focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically speaking, the strain’s mildly relaxing effects can provide some subtle relief for aches and pains, while its anti-inflammatory properties may soothe everyday irritations like nausea and headaches. Because its onset is associated with recursive, cerebral thought patterns, Lemon Drop is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial breeders have claimed responsibility for Lemon Drop’s creation and none have made seeds of the strain available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” The bud can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Lemon Drop flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.Somewhat hard to come by, Lemon Drop is a great strain for energetic daytime use. Enjoy it as a way to stimulate creativity, gain motivation, or simply to savor for its refreshing citrus bouquet.\n"

        "description": "Cabbage Patch is a sativa-dominant hybrid with a complex, fruity taste and a bouncy, social high. This strain, whose creator is unknown, combines the flavor of Cherry Pie with the cerebral strength of Durban Poison. Slightly less intense than some pure landrace sativas, this bud’s balance of focus and relaxation makes it a great choice for fans of hybrids. High amounts of THC, measured at between 17% and 27%, ensure that Cabbage Patch can be potent for even experienced cannabis consumers.Cabbage Patch is marked by small to medium-sized buds. Like actually cabbages, these flowers cling together in a tight, dense structure. The tightly-coiled leaves are a dark shade of mossy green and are filled with vibrant, almost neon orange pistils. Finally, particularly thick coat of trichomes covers the flowers’ inner and outer surfaces and gives them an almost white appearance, even from a distance.When properly cured, Cabbage Patch gives off a pleasant aromatic combination of musk and fruit, a scent that is reminiscent of leather. This bud has also inherited parent strain Cherry Pie’s bright notes of cherry. There’s an acidic lemon scent hanging underneath as well. When ground up or broken apart, Cabbage Patch’s flowers give off a more robust odor of soil, with some hashy undertones. When combusted, this strain burns with a smooth, palatable smoke that tastes sour and tangy on the exhale.Uncharacteristically for a sativa, Cabbage Patch is a creeper of a strain that may take several minutes to reveal its potency. Eventually, smokers feel a concerted pressure around the temples and the back of the neck. A surge of energy accompanies this strange sensation and may inspire consumers to get up and move. Cabbage Patch also brings about some cerebral stimulation, paving the way for productivity. The strain can be an effective aid for powering through a mountain of work, whether the work is problem-oriented or creative and open-ended.Alternatively, it can inspire artistic endeavors like drawing or writing, as it frees up any inhibitions on the imagination. Some physical tingle keeps this bud’s effects from becoming too head-centered. In social situations, Cabbage Patch’s freely associative effects may spark stimulating conversations with like-minded friends. Users should beware that in larger doses, the strain can leave the mind unfocused, making it better for daydreaming or just for lounging around the house. Due to its initial burst of energy, Cabbage Patch is better suited to daytime than to evening use. A little bit of this bud can go a long, even for cannabis veterans.Cabbage Patch may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its burst of euphoria can temporarily relieve mild to moderate stress and depression. Additionally, its cerebral focus can also be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to sustain concentration. The strain’s mildly relaxing effects can also soothe deep-seated aches and pains. Because it can bring about obsessive, recursive patterns of thinking, Cabbage Patch is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No large-scale breeders have claimed responsibility for creating Cabbage Patch and none have made seeds of the strain available for sale online. Instead, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This bud can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Finally, Cabbage Patch’s mostly sativa genetics suggest taller, branchy plants that may need to be pruned back early in the vegetative stage.Growers should also cure their harvest by hanging the buds upside down for about a week in conditions with 50% humidity and 70 degree temperatures. Once the stems can easily snap off the flowers, the flowers can be sealed in airtight jars in ambient humidity of 60-65% and a temperature of around 70 degrees. While curing, the buds should be checked daily for a week for any signs of mold.Cabbage Patch can be a great way to start the weekend or to enliven a party. Its upbeat, social vibes may even have you doing the cabbage patch.\n"

        "description": "Not all cannabis enthusiasts are nature lovers, but a few tokes of Earth OG could turn around any holdouts. Created by Apothecary Genetics, the breeders who gave us Grape Ape and Platinum OG, this well-balanced hybrid combined pungent Sour Diesel with resinous Ghost OG. The result is an exceptionally dank, musky strain that offers a memorable combination of stimulation and relaxation. Unlike some more sativa-dominant hybrids, Earth OG tends to keep its consumers centered, with both feet on the ground, even as their minds float away to other planets. Earth OG’s THC has been measured at between 15% and 22%.As potent as this strain is, its flowers tend to be visually unimpressive. These buds are on the small size, clinging together in a clustered, popcorn-like formation. The leaves curl inward in the dense, tight bud structure usually associated with indica varieties. These leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are twisted through with dark orange to brown pistils. Sometimes, phenotypes of Earth OG express purple hues, ranging from lavender to deep indigo; these surprising colors are the result of anthocyanin pigments, which are activated by colder than average temperatures during the growth process. Finally, a thick coat of translucent white trichomes give these already-colorful buds a slightly icy sheen.Flowers of Earth OG can smell like taking a long walk in the woods, with rich notes of soil and wood. On closer inspection, there are some bright hints of lemon hanging underneath. Meanwhile, grinding up Earth OG’s dense flowers yields a hint of pepper and spice. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, this strain burns with a harsh smoke that can tickle the palate and induce coughing. On the exhale, this strain leaves behind the taste of diesel with a bit of wood. Earth OG’s high takes hold quickly. Smokers can quickly detect an uptick in emotional well-being. At the same time, a tingly feeling of relaxation spreads down from the neck through the core and limbs. Thoughts can take on a fast-paced, cerebral quality, as concepts and ideas jump from one to the next in free association. In the right set and setting, this head rush is balanced out by Earth OG’s indica side, which keeps tokers on an even keel. The high can be spent however the user desires. It can aid protracted work of any kind, mental or physical. Alternatively, it may trigger a calm, stationary mindset, helping smokers to kick back and indulge in some introspection. This bud can usually illuminate a boring agenda or spice up a weak party. At higher doses, Earth OG’s physical sedation can turn a corner into couchlock, forcing many users to kick back and melt into their surroundings. The strain is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening, when its taper down from energy into relaxation can be fully savored.Earth OG’s wide-reaching effects may also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its mood-elevating properties can temporarily improve the harsh symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, its numbing properties can relieve deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. In large enough amounts, Earth OG can even counteract insomnia, lulling smokers into a deep, restful sleep. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume this potentially intense strain with caution.Fortunately for home growers, Apothecary Genetics has made seeds of Earth OG available for sale online. Once obtained, it can successfully be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers looking to bring out the bud’s eye-catching purple hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average. Earthy OG flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It offers only a modest yield of about 18 to 33 grams (or .6 to 1.1 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.A strain worthy of Mother Gaia herself, Earth OG deserves a spot in any hybrid lover’s stash. It’s as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared with friends.\n"

        "description": "Exodus Cheese - also known as U.K. Cheese - is a seminal hybrid of mysterious origin. Said to have originated with British breeders Exodus, it may be a distinct phenotype of Skunk #1. Cheese’s balanced effects and unique, pungent flavor profile make it an attractive choice for relaxing recreational use. With a moderate 10% to 18% THC content, Exodus Cheese offers a satisfying, mellow high.Exodus Cheese has large, fluffy buds that adhere in an elongated, roughly cylindrical shape. The flowers’ loose, sativa-like leaves spiral off of their calyxes. When cured, these leaves are typically a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with orange and brown pistils. Finally, a relatively sparse coating of sticky trichomes covers these buds and gives them a wet, dewy appearance.This strain is notoriously pungent - it gives off a powerfully tangy and slightly sweet odor, like aged blue cheese. Breaking the buds apart yields more damp, earthy notes. These contrasting scents make for a strong, sour taste that some users describe as unpleasant. After exhale, a sharp tang may linger on the palate. Those consuming in public should note that Exodus Cheese can be a very pungent strain whose odor may carry; anyone concerned with maintaining discretion should take the necessary precautions.Exodus Cheese has quick-acting, euphoric effects that initially lean towards the sativa end of the spectrum. Initially, the strain make itself known with a subtle tingle around the eyes and temples. Additionally, smokers may sense a change in perception, as certain external stimuli take on new intensity or dimensions. As they adjust to these physical sensations, users report an uplift in mood that is not necessarily accompanied by a strong cerebral focus. Instead of zeroing in on any tasks at hand or any swarming ideas, consumers’ minds tend to become rambling and open to suggestibility. This makes Exodus Cheese a great way to spice up otherwise mundane chores or errands. In social settings, the strain can also pave the way for stimulating conversations with like-minded friends. Eventually, these happy, floaty feelings progress into a body high that starts off as tingly, as waves of relaxation begin at the base of the neck and spread downward through the core and limbs. As users feel themselves unwind, they may notice that deep breathing happens more easily and that any muscular tightness is loosened. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes more and more likely. In its later stages, Exodus Cheese can be helpful for kicking back after a long day or week of work. Because of its two-stage high, this bud is best enjoyed in the afternoon or early evening when smokers can fully savor the decrescendo into motionless relaxation.Exodus Cheese can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Psychologically, it can provide temporary relief from the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. The physical effects of Exodus Cheese are said to relieve pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to serious conditions like lupus. Many also report relief from everyday irritations like indigestion or recurring headaches. Because its mental effects are more hazy than intense and cerebral, Exodus Cheese can be a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Exodus Cheese are available from several online retailers. Alternatively, home growers can take clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.”. A moderately difficult grow, it can be grown inside with sufficient space to accommodate its strong lateral branching. Higher branches may need supports to stop from sagging. The flowering period happens within eight weeks indoors and outdoor plants are ready for harvest in late September. Even during the pre-flowering vegetative stage, Exodus Cheese can be very smelly, making discretion difficult without the use of odor-blocking carbon filters.As craft Cannabis strains continue to proliferate, Exodus Cheese retains its popularity as a strong, middle-of-the-road hybrid. Much like Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies, it is an excellent example of how even distinct phenotypes of a single strain can be selectively bred to create an entirely new variety.\n"

        "description": "Goo is one strain whose name perfectly describes how a user might feel after indulging. This hard-hitting indica offers smokers a deep, fruity aroma before hitting them with long-lasting sedative effects. It is a cross between tasty favorite Blueberry and a Hindu Kush landrace. Best suited to low-key, nighttime use, Goo is sure to impress both novice and veteran cannabis consumers. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Goo’s bag appeal is obvious right away. The medium to large-sized flowers tend to be almost conical, slimming down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Small, olive green leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. These leaves are twisted through with hairy yellowish pistils and are coated in translucent trichomes. Paying testament to this strain’s name, these trichomes also give the flowers an especially sticky, goopy texture.When properly cured, Goo’s primary scent is the unmistakable aroma of blueberries. There are also some ripe citrus and berry notes lurking underneath these top notes. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the dense buds gives off a woodsy, hashy scent -- evidence of its Hindu Kush parentage. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Goo burns with an acrid smoke that can trigger coughing and watery eyes. This smoke has a distinct sour tinge on the exhale.Goo’s high creeps up on the smoker, sometimes taking several minutes to set in. Initial effects manifest as an unfamiliar tingle around the eyes and temples. This sensation soon gives way to waves of relaxation that roll down the neck and back. Within minutes, smokers may notice that their sensory perception is altered, with certain sight and sounds taking on a new intensity. The ensuing psychedelic feeling can be a fun way to enhance trippy music and spacey movies. Users certainly shouldn’t plan on getting anything done after sampling this complex strain. Its dreamy, rambling mindset can make it difficult to focus on demanding tasks. When consumed in social situations, Goo can put your friends’ minds at ease and facilitate camaraderie. At higher doses, this bud is liable to lay smokers out flat on the closes comfortable surface as the outside world falls out of focus. Goo can also be a great way to lull already sleepy smokers into a deep, fulfilling sleep. Because of its mostly sedative vibes, Goo is more appropriate for evening and bedtime use.Goo’s thoroughly relaxing effects can have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can provoke hunger pangs, making it useful to patients who may have lost their appetites to disease or to harsh treatments like chemotherapy. It can also soothe aches and pains, both temporary and chronic. The bud’s anti-inflammatory effects may take care of common irritations like headaches and upset stomachs. As noted, it can also counteract insomnia with its soporific haze. Psychologically speaking, Goo can even temporarily take the edge off of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Because intensely cerebral effects are rarely reported, this strain can be a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial-scale breeders have taken responsibility for creating this indica, and its seeds are not available for sale online. Instead, home growers should obtain clippings of a mature plant from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.”  Goo can be grown indoors or out; however, success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These indica-typical plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers should be sure to regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can prevent light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. Goo flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors.Not to be confused with the similarly landrace-derived Afgoo, Goo is a true knockout indica. It’s enjoyable when used for introspective solo time and when shared with a small group of like-minded friends.\n"

        "description": "Killing Fields is a powerhouse strain with strong roots. Bred by the Netherland-based Sannie Seeds, the creators of strains like Selene and Mad Scientist, this bud is a cross between sativa favorite Jack Herer and landrace-inflected The One. Certainly not a strain for newcomers or for the lighthearted, Killing Fields offers searing cerebral effects and a crowd-pleasing herbal aroma. This variety’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 15% and 22%.Killing Fields’ flowers are sure to catch the eye. These buds are typically medium in size and have a tapered, spade-like shape with a broad base and a pointed tip. Despite the strain’s mostly sativa genetics, its flowers cling together in the dense, solid bud structure usually associated with indicas. More often than not, Killing Fields’ flowers are a deep, dark shade of purple with small patches of mossy green and are threaded through with hairy orange pistils. Any purple hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins are activated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, these colorful flowers are coated in cloudy white trichomes that give them an icy sheen.Flowers of Killing Fields hit the smoker right away with a sweet citrus aroma. There are also some distinct notes of grape, while parent strain Jack Herer imparts some herbal hints of sage. Grinding up these tight buds yields a surprisingly spicy, peppery odor. When burnt, Killing Fields burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke that isn’t likely to trigger a coughing fit. This smoke has a tangy lemon funk on the exhale. Smokers trying to maintain discretion should keep in mind that Killing Fields can be a very pungent strain that may call for a few precautionsKillings Fields’ effects take hold quickly. The first observable sign of an altered state is typically a pressure in the cheeks and temples. This physical sensation is accompanied by a change in the user’s thinking patterns. Thoughts may jump around in a freely associative manner; alternatively, the smoker’s thoughts may converge on a single topic, leading them to examine it from every possible angle. As such, Killing Fields can be a good strain for powering through analytical, problem-oriented work as well as more freewheeling creative projects. Although some consumers may find this intense, head-centered experienced overwhelming, it can provide lucid concentration for others. In the right set and setting, this bud’s energy and clarity of mind can help to boost smokers out of a funk or to get them up and moving. Killing Fields can also be uniquely social, provoking free-flowing conversation among like-minded friends. With very few physical effects, Killing Fields is unlikely to leave smokers drowsy or couchlocked. As such, this buzzy strain is appropriate for wake-and-bake or afternoon use, but can leave users wired if it’s consumed at bedtime.Killing Fields’ strong mental effects can also have uses for medical cannabis patients. It can aid focus and persistence for those with attention deficit disorders. It may also temporarily soothe the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, the strain’s anti-inflammatory properties can ease everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because its onset often brings about intensely recursive patterns of thinking, Killing Fields is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Sannie’s has made sees of Killing Fields available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Because of its sativa properties, this bud’s plants tend to be very tall and may require growers to prune back its branches early in the vegetative stage. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s bold purple shades should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures later on in the vegetative stage. Killing Fields flowers within an exceptionally long 11 to 13 weeks when grown indoors. Just as it can be a pungent smoke, this strain can be a very pungent grow, and indoor growers looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters.Although its name is a reference -- and a frankly tasteless one -- to the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, Killing Fields is likely to bring about a soothing, non-violent state of mind.\n"

        "description": "Locomotion is an indica-dominant hybrid that makes the best of its prestigious genetics. This strain comes to us from Heroes of the Farm, the same growing collective that created Conspiracy Kush. It is a cross between the uber-popular Blue Dream and buzzy sativa Trainwreck. The result is a dank bud that offers a long-lasting, stoney high wit some traces of mental acuity. A little bit of Locomotion goes a long way, even for experienced cannabis consumers. This strain’s THC level has been measured at between 15% and 23%.Locomotion’s flowers are impressively large and chunky in appearance. These buds adhere in the dense, solid bud structure that is characteristic of indica varieties. The leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems and are a drab, mossy green. Bright orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants -- wind their way through the dense flowers. Finally, translucent amber-colored trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these buds, giving them an oddly yellow sheen.When properly cured, Locomotion’s flowers give off the musky scent of damp soil and hash. These earthy notes are undercut by the woodsy scent of fresh pine. Grinding up the sticky blossoms yields a bit of spice and hash. When combusted in a joint or a pipe, Locomotion burns with a surprisingly smooth, palatable smoke. This thick smoke tastes like diesel with a touch of fruit on the exhale.Locomotion acts quickly for an indica-dominant strain. Almost immediately, users are struck by a trippy, disorienting feeling that points to sensory distortion -- most notably, feelings of time dilation set in, as well as an increased sensitivity to light and loud sounds. These altered sensations are accompanied by a gradual increase in physical relaxation that spread down the neck and through the core and limbs like waves. Surprisingly, Locomotion also stimulates mental acuity, allowing smokers to maintain lucidity as their thoughts become free-flowing and uninhibited. This mindset allows for the body to relax under heavy, almost immobilizing relaxation while the mind is allowed to open up and wander. The harmonious balance between this feeling of cerebral concentration and physical sedation is euphoric for many. Provided that they have the necessary energy, smokers are typically able to get work or reading done while under Locomotion’s influence. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, the strain’s vibe becomes more dreamy; in these later stages, Locomotion is perfect for spacing out and engaging in some introspective solo time. Drowsiness and deep sleep may easily set in. As a result, this strain is best reserved for consumption at night, as it may incapacitate smokers -- especially novices -- during the day.Locomotion can also have uses for medical cannabis patients. Its easygoing, unperturbed mood can temporarily counteract the symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. As noted, it can induce a restful sleep and thereby serve as an antidote to insomnia. Physiologically speaking, this bud’s sedative power can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Its anti-inflammatory effects, meanwhile, may lessen everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it does not often lead to the kind of recursive thinking that progresses to paranoia, Locomotion is a good option for patients who have a low THC tolerance or who are prone to panic.Fortunately for home growers, Heroes of the Farm has made seeds of Locomotion available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants are easily accommodated indoors, where they grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers should regularly “top” their crops by pruning back any broad, light-blocking fan leaves that can inhibit the flowering of any low-growing nodes. Locomotion flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers at harvest time.Contrary to the frenetic energy implied by its name, Locomotion is a luxurious strain to smoke at the end of a long day. Friends will thank you if you bring some to share in a small, intimate setting -- just be sure to bring enough.\n"

        "description": "As its name implies, Mammoth is a sativa with larger-than-life flowers, flavors, and buzzy effects. It is the brainchild of The Bank of Cannabis Genetics, the creators of Orange Kush and Bobblehead, and is a cross between unique hybrid LA Confidential and the very resinous Snowcap. Mammoth is a great strain for consumers who want to illuminate their daily agenda without becoming totally incapacitated. Mammoth’s THC levels have been measured at between 12% and 21%.Mammoth’s flowers are indeed Mammoth-sized, clinging together in elongated, almost cylindrical shapes. These huge buds have the dense, tightly-packed structure that more commonly comes with indicas. The leaves are a pale shade of spring green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Parent strain Snowcap imparts its tendency for resin production: Mammoth’s buds are coated in translucent white trichomes, which account for the strain’s psychoactivity and makes it hard to break up without a quality grinder.When properly cured, Mammoth gives off a pleasant scent reminiscent of honey or molasses -- both unconventional aromas when it comes to cannabis genetics. These sweet scents are accented by a fruity, citrus-like character. Grinding up the sticky buds releases a robust earthy odor. When burnt, Mammoth gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke that tastes simultaneously fruity and earthy on the exhale.Mammoth’s high takes effect quickly, first hitting the smoker with a disorienting pressure in the face, particularly around the eyes and temples. Users soon detect an uptick in mental acuity, with certain concepts or ideas taking on newfound dimensions or intensity. The downside of this cerebral stimulation is that a troubled mind may wander into paranoid territory. Ideally, though, Mammoth provides the lucid concentration needed to power through a pile of work, whether it’s rigid and problem-oriented or more free and imaginative. Mammoth is not without some physical relaxation, though. Within some time, users may feel a tingle spread down from the neck and through the core and limbs. While not liable to lay smokers out flat, this somatic action is enough to calm down an active nervous system and allow for deep and easy breathing. The combination of physical and mental effects makes Mammoth a great strain for enjoying activities that require both physical and mental coordination -- it can be particularly fun to consume before a nature hike or a daily run. In the right set and setting, this strain can also serve as a powerful aphrodisiac. A quintessential wake-and-bake varietal, Mammoth can also be good for afternoon or early evening use; if smoked before bed, it’s likely to keep users awake and wired.Mammoth can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The sedation that comes through on its backend can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia. To a lesser degree, anti-inflammatory properties may relieve afflictions like nausea and headaches. Psychologically speaking, Mammoth can be a boon for patients with attention deficit disorders, helping them to sustain concentration on single tasks. It can also take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Because its onset is associated with the kind of recursive thinking patterns that lead to paranoia, Mammoth is not recommended for those who are prone to anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Mammoth’s breeders have made seeds of the strain available for sale online. It can be a good choice for newcomers to cultivation, as both of its parents strains are hardy and resistant to disease and adverse conditions. This bud can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. If fostered indoors, this strain’s characteristically tall heights should be managed by pruning back its branches early on in the vegetative stage. Mammoth flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. It offers patient growers high yields of between 650 and 1350 grams of flower for every 1000 watts of light. Mammoth is a great option for smokers who’d like to stimulate their minds without feeling jumpy or agitated. Its complex, honey-tinged flavor profile is icing on this trippy cake.\n"

        "description": "Mexico’s unique climate and mountainous terrain makes it one of the few global regions hospitable to growing cannabis. Mexico is home to several landrace strains, all of which have decidedly sativa characteristics thanks to the country’s high elevations. There are several distinct strains that could be called “Mexican,” many of which have proven useful in crossbreeding inventive new varieties. What follows is a summary of some of the prime characteristics associated with Mexican sativa landraces.Sometimes referred to as “brick weed,” Mexican cannabis has an undeserved reputation for being of inferior quality. This is likely due to the fact that the overly dry and seed-filled Mexican cannabis that flooded the Southern U.S. market in the 1970s and 80s was pressed into solid bricks. In their raw, unprocessed form, genuine Mexican sativas may have a striking appearance for American consumers accustomed to bud that’s been packaged by dispensaries and delivery services. Mexican flowers are typically elongated and spindly rather than nugget-like and tightly packed. Instead of curling tightly inward, these strains’ leaves are loose and piecey and may have a fluffy appearance when viewed from afar. The leaves are a bright shade of lime green and are threaded through with brown to vibrant orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants. Due to cold nighttime temperatures in the high altitude environment where much of Mexico’s cannabis is grown, these flowers also frequently boast blue and purple hues in their leaves -- pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics that are stimulated by colder than average weather. Finally, cloudy amber-colored trichomes cover these leafy buds and give them a slightly yellow glow. Mexican cannabis has a very earthy and dank odor, with a considerably skunky pungency. There’s also a woodsy scent lurking underneath while grinding up the buds releases spicy, peppery notes. Despite this funky flavor profile, Mexican sativas tend to burn with a smooth and palatable smoke when combusted. This smoke can have a tangy, diesel scent on the exhale.These landrace sativas tend to creep up on the consumer -- but when they do hit, they’re noticeable right away. Smokers will notice a concerted pressure in the face, especially around the eyes and temples. Along with this novel physical sensation comes an uptick in cerebral thinking, as ideas jump from one to the next in free association. In its early stages, this mental stimulation can be helpful in aiding concentration or in making mundane chores and errands more interesting. As the high progresses, though, smokers’ mindsets can become more foggy and dreamlike and may not be as well-suited to work that demands acute focus. Some degree of physical relaxation can enable deep breathing and can eliminate any lingering muscular tension. Appetite stimulation is commonly reported. More so than with other varieties, Mexican sativas are often said to trigger a dry mouth and dry eyes. More appropriate for daytime than for evening use, Mexican bud is also said to have a shorter than average high.Mexican sativas can also be of use to medical cannabis patients, thanks to their mentally stimulating and mood-elevating properties. They may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on a single task. They can also provide temporary respite from mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. The subtle anti-inflammatory properties of these varieties may soothe bodily irritations like headaches and indigestion. Because the mental effects of these strains are not particularly intense, they may be appropriate for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Many sources purport to sell seeds or clones of authentic Mexican landrace strains; however, consumers should investigate the reputation and reliability of any sources, as the original stock of these strains is considered rare. Once obtained, Mexican strains can be grown indoors or out, and can be particularly resistant to adverse conditions if fostered outdoors. These plants grow tall and should be contained by trimming back branches and stems early on in the vegetative process. As with many pure sativas, Mexican cannabis has a long flowering period, in this case taking as many as 16 weeks before reaching maturity.If true Mexican landrace sativa can be obtained, it’s a must-try for any cannabis enthusiast. This unique, subtle strain has served as a parent for other popular varieties like Acapulco Gold, Trainwreck, and Haze.\n"

        "description": "Milky Way is an indica-dominant hybrid that’s perfectly suited to zoning out and gazing up at the stars. This strain was created by prolific New Zealand-based Kiwiseeds as a combination of popular hybrid Northern Lights and the pungent and potent Hash Plant. The bud has a surprisingly light and airy flavor profile and offers mostly relaxing, full-bodied effects. More of a luxurious evening smoke than a buzzy daytime treat, Milky Way’s potency has been measured at between 14% and 22%.Milky Way is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that have a slightly tapered appearance, like mini cypress trees. These dense and chunky buds adhere in the solid structure that one would expect of a predominantly indica strain. The tightly-curled leaves are a vibrant lime green and are shot through with hairy yellow and orange pistils. Finally, cloudy whitish trichomes coat the bud’s inner and outer nooks, giving these flowers a slightly dusty, glittering appearance, not unlike the milky way galaxy itself.When properly cured, Milky Way has a decidedly earthy aroma, with notes reminiscent of soil and dried leaves. Some sweet and fruity accents mix with these dank scents and give the flowers a slightly fermented odor. Meanwhile, grinding up the tight buds gives off herbal and floral hints, evidence of Thai in the lineage of parent strain Northern Lights. When combusted, Milky Way burns with a smooth and pleasant smoke that tastes both earthy and floral on the exhale. Toke on this strain in a clean pipe or a joint to fully appreciate its subtle flavors.Milky Way is a creeper of a strain and may take as many as 15 minutes after smokers have exhaled before making its effects fully felt. Initial symptoms may manifest as a tingle or a pressure around the eyes and temples, soon accompanied by a constriction at the back of the neck. Gradually, users may feel themselves relax as Milky Way pulverizes any muscular tightness or tension and allows breathing to happen more fully and deeply. This soothing vibe is likely to inspire smokers to seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. At first, it may not lead to couchlock and can allow for some relative mobility and mental stimulation. This mental activity is more dopey and dreamy than cerebral though, and is more at home in jovial social situations than as a way to complete a mountain of demanding work. Instead, use Milky Way to facilitate conversation or camaraderie among like-minded friends. Alternatively, enjoy its trippy, otherworldly effects while spacing out alone to an atmospheric soundtrack of your choosing. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, smokers may become locked into their surroundings as the rest of the world falls away. It may come as no surprise, then, that this potent indica is recommended for nighttime use.Milky Way’s sedative, almost narcotic effects can have several benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can provide temporary reprieve from stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Its numbing effects may also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, while its anti-inflammatory properties can take care of minor irritations like headaches and nausea. In sufficient doses, the strain can even lull insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because it is unlikely to pull smokers into intense and recursive patterns of thinking, Milky Way is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Kiwiseeds has made seeds of Milky Way available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a partially humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70 to 80 degree Fahrenheit range. Like many indicas, plants grow short and bushy and often require growers to “top” them by trimming any broad fan leaves that can prevent light and air from nurturing low-growing flowering nodes. Milky Way flowers quickly, at 7 to 8 weeks indoors and in early September outdoors. It offers growers a high yield for their efforts of about 51 to 60 grams (or 1.8 to 2.1 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Milky Way is just the thing for taking the edge off of stressful circumstances or moods. If spotted on dispensary shelves, it’s a must-try for fans of hard-hitting indicas.\n"

        "description": "\"All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean a thang,” raps Ludacris on his trippy 2004 track, \"Blueberry Yum Yum.\"  Although it's unclear whether this strain was named after the song or vice-versa, Blueberry Yum Yum has nevertheless gained plenty of admirers for its tasty, all-purpose qualities. This bud is a well-balanced hybrid with an instantly appealing smell and taste. Crossed from staple Blueberry and South African landrace sativa Durban Poison, this strain has a potent, balanced high that backs up its initial bag appeal. Its THC has been measured at between 15% and 25%Blueberry Yum Yum has relatively small flowers that adhere in a spade-like shape, tapering from a broad base down to a pointed tip. These buds have a somewhat loose structure -- the ragged, fluffy-looking leaves are not densely packed and can be easily torn away from their central stems. These leaves themselves are a dark shade of mossy green, although certain phenotypes may express some subtle shades of brick red. Dark orange and brown pistils wind their way through these flowers. Finally, although they don’t appear to be as coated with trichomes as many other strains, Blueberry Yum Yum’s dried flowers are still very sticky and typically need a grinder to be broken up.When Blueberry Yum Yum’s flowers are properly cured, a fruity molasses comes through on initial inspection, likely courtesy of parent strain Blueberry. There are also some fresh notes of pine and herbs hanging out underneath, making the overall impression reminiscent of Haze varieties. If these buds are broken apart or ground up, there’s a hint of skunk. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Blueberry Yum Yum burns with a pleasantly smooth and easily palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke has a sweet aftertaste with distinct pine and berry flavors that complement each other well.With a genetic profile that includes both indica and sativa landrace strains, Blueberry Yum Yum offers the full gamut of physical and psychoactive effects. The strain’s effects manifest quickly, exerting a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples. Once they adjust to this strange sensation, users describe a warm, almost euphoric feeling. This sense of emotional well-being is soon accompanied by an uptick in cerebral thinking, marked by quickly moving and freely-associative thoughts. This heady mindset can be enjoyed passively or more actively put to work in creative pursuits. Blueberry Yum Yum also has a mild body buzz that may set in as the high progresses. Although smokers are unlikely to experience full-on couch lock, muscular tension may decrease and deep breathing may happen more easily. Because of this holistic balance between body and mind, users may also enjoy activities that employ both physical and mental exertion, like light exercise, video games, and even sex. Blueberry Yum Yum’s mostly buzzy, head-focused effects make it more appropriate for daytime use; it can be very enjoy as a wake-and-bake treat.Blueberry Yum Yum’s versatile effects may also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its cerebral intensity can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on single tasks. Its balanced, easygoing mood can also temporarily relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Blueberry Yum Yum can soothe deep-seated aches and pains as well as minor irritations like headaches. Because its thought patterns may lead to paranoia in certain circumstances, this strain is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Blueberry Yum Yum are not widely available; as such, prospective home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow clones. Blueberry Yum Yum can be cultivated indoors or outdoors and is considered a good option for novice growers, as it is naturally resistant to adverse conditions. Its plants are more indica in stature, with relatively bushy, squat growth. Because of its tendency to grow horizontal branches, indoor growers will want to ensure plenty of room for the cultivation of multiple plants. At flowering time, plants have a lower than average yield.Blueberry Yum Yum’s buzzy energy and mind-expanding prop make it great for accomplishing work, whether it’s analytical or creative. This is also a great strain to break out at parties -- but be sure to bring enough to share, as this bud’s fruity odor is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Grape Skunk is a powerful cross breed of three popular and flavorful strains: Grapefruit, Super Skunk, and Blueberry. If you’re looking for a high that’s both hard-hitting and tasty, you’ve come to the right place. An indica-dominant hybrid, it offers strong effects and a great flavor profile.With high ranking THC levels, 22% on the low end, and 3% CBD, this strain brings you a strong but appetizing high. Grape Skunk’s palette is exceptional, offering a robust berry scent with hints of earth and skunk on the tail end. Expect a grape, almost wine-like taste on the initial inhale with a lingering flavor combo of sweet and bitter as you exhale. These dark purple nugs are accented with sienna colored hairs and frosty white trichomes. The phrase “one hitter quitter” is an accurate portrayal of this bud’s strength. Not to be underestimated by its sweet flavor, the effects of Grape Skunk are instant. After your first inhale, sink into a full body tingle as your limbs and face relax. You’ll be flush with new ideas, but don’t plan to get much done as this strain commonly leaves users unable to concentrate. This bud is best for use in the evening due to its nearly stupefying properties. While it slows you down quite a bit, it’s not known to make users very sleepy. Some describe Grape Skunk as a chaotic high, so it is not recommended for those who suffer from panic attacks or paranoia. Users who treat anxiety disorders might like to steer clear of this gal as well. Because of its all over numbing properties, users who suffer from aches, chronic pain, arthritis, headaches, or migraines will be in heaven. Novice smokers may want to use a vaporizer with Grape Skunk as its resulting cough can be harsh. For new growers, ask a friend to help you get this plant started. It is a relatively easy one to maintain, but growing from seed may be tricky if you are inexperienced. This plant tends to grow short and bushy, flowering in about 7 to 8 weeks. It flourishes indoors and outdoors, and will have a bright blue hue in the right conditions. Because of its skunky scent, those that need to be discrete may want to invest in a smell proof set-up. For a complete head in the clouds, body glued to the floor kind of high, this will be your go-to strain. Clear your schedule and enjoy the all over buzz this berry sweet goodness will have you feeling from the very first puff.\n"

        "description": "Although Haole is descended from Hawaiian landraces, its genetics are not entirely native to Hawaii -- in fact, the word Haole is Hawaiian for “foreigner.” This indica-dominant hybrid is a cross between Hawaiian sativa Maui Wowie and popular mainland hybrid LA Confidential. It was created by Colorado-based Reserva Privada, the breeders responsible for creating Strawberry Banana and Citrix. With a memorably spicy taste and a soothing balance between relaxing and stimulating effects, Haole is an enjoyable strain no matter where you’re from. Its THC level has been tested at between 12% and 17%.Haole is marked by relatively small, spherical buds. Although tiny, these flowers still manage to impress with a dense, tight bud structure. The leaves are a vibrant shade of lime green and are twisted through with curly orange and yellowish pistils. A blanket of frosty, translucent white trichomes caps off these colorful flowers and accounts for their high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Haole’s flowers burst with an earthy, funky scent, reminiscent of some classic Kush strains. These dank notes are accompanied by notably sweet undertones. Meanwhile, grinding up the tight flowers releases some hints of spice. When combusted, Haole burns with a somewhat harsh smoke that irritate the sinuses and trigger coughing. On the exhale, this acrid smoke leaves behind a sweet, slightly peppery taste. Finally, smokers should keep in mind that this can be a particularly pungent smoke, and may want to take some precaution if discretion is desired.Haole offers a creeper of a high -- several minutes after savoring (or coughing up) this bud, smokers may begin to feel a tingle in the neck and temples, spreading slowly downward through the spine. This sensation soon melts into a pervasive body stone, numbing the extremities and making them feel suddenly heavy. Some users may also detect a decrease in muscular tension. Within short order, consumers are plunged into a deep feeling of relaxation and, in the right circumstances, may fall victim to couchlock. After an hour or so, though, Haole’s dreamy, lazy mindset gives way to the strain’s sativa side: a strong cerebral mindset takes over, causing rapid cycles of freely-associative thought. While smokers may remain stationary thanks to this bud’s weighty effects, they can still accomplish work -- whether it’s task-based and analytical or more freewheeling and creative. Haole’s combination of relaxation and mental engagement also makes it a very social strain that can facilitate easy conversation and good vibes among like-minded friends. Best enjoyed in the late afternoon to early evening, Haole should be avoided just before bed, as it’s liable to hit smokers with some undesirable wired energy that can render sleep impossible.Haole may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its soothing physical effects can relieve aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. The strain’s anti-inflammatory effects may also take care of everyday irritations like headaches and indigestion. Psychologically speaking, Haole can temporarily take the edge off of some cases of stress and depression. It may also help those with attention deficit disorders sustain focus on single tasks. Because of the burst of cerebral energy on its backend, Haole may not be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Although seeds of Haole were once available for sale online from Reserva Privada, they do not appear to be consistently stocked. As such, home growers may need to obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical clones. Fortunately, the bud’s sturdy landrace genetics make it an easy grow that’s resistant to adverse conditions and user-friendly for newcomers to cultivation. Plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and may require occasional pruning of their large, light-blocking fan leaves. Haole flowers within a long 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, just as this can be a pungent smoke, it can be a very smelly grow; indoor growers looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Haole’s rare psychoactive profile, building from a body stone to a soaring cerebral high, is valuable for all sorts of moods and settings and can be appreciated by cannabis newbies and veterans alike.\n"

        "description": "Hog is an extremely potent pure indica strain with uncertain parentage. Created by Amsterdam breeder TH Seeds, the breeders responsible for Bubble Gum and A-Train, it is thought to be a hybrid bred from strong North American indicas. Prized for its pseudo-narcotic effects, Hog was named Top Indica strain in the 2002 High Times Cannabis Cup. This bud is notorious for its stinky, sour pungency. Nevertheless, Hog ’s psychoactivity receives high marks from cannabis testing lab Analytical 360, which has consistently measured its THC content at between 16% and 23%.Hog offers plump buds that range in shape from pointy and spadelike to almost cylindrical. The flowers cling together in a classically dense indica structure, with leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with a high volume of orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to collect pollen from fertilizing male plants). Occasionally, phenotypes of Hog show off pale shades of purple in their leaves -- these surprising hues come about when pigments in the strain’s genetics called anthocyanins are stimulated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, icy with trichomes give these already-colorful buds a white sheen when viewed from afar.The resinous flowers have a pungently sour, earthy smell (which some consider to be the source to the strain’s beastly name). Lurking under these untamed scents is a woodsy, almost piney odor.When broken open, Hog’s buds have an even stronger, somewhat unpleasant sour scent. If burnt pipe or joint, Hog gives off an acrid, earthy smoke that may tickle the smoker’s sinuses and induce coughing or even tears. Flavors of dirt and pepper linger on the palate after they exhale.Hog creeps up on users, sometimes taking as many as fifteen minutes to reveal the extent of its mellow effects. Initial symptoms manifest as a pressure around the eyes and temples. This feeling soon melts into a slow, heavy body high that’s great for stretching out horizontally and enjoying trippy some music or movies. Hog’s physically numbing effects may actually be so intense as to cause a feeling to disorientation or depersonalization for some smokers. The bud’s mental effects are as sedative as its physical ones, dulling any sharp concerns or stresses. Rather than exacting and cerebral, Hog’s mindset is more spacey, allowing smokers to daydream at will; this is not a strain to consume if you’re planning on getting any work done. On the other hand, Hog can be a very social bud to enjoy if you’re planning a mellow night in with friends. Eventually, this drowsy strain may lead to couch (or bed) lock, trapping smokers in place in the closest comfortable surroundings. Best enjoyed at night -- or during an especially slow day -- Hog is known for immobilizing even more experienced smokers. Finally, a small amount of this bud is said to go quite a long way.In addition to its recreationally calming properties, Hog has medicinal value in dulling pain, whether it’s chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia, or simply temporary. Hog’s anti-inflammatory properties may also take care of minor annoyances like headaches and nausea. Psychologically, the strain can temporarily improve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress, depression, and anxiety. Its sleepy vibes may also counteract stubborn cases of insomnia. Because Hog is not likely to bring about intense patterns of recursive thinking, it can be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Hog are available online from breeders TH Seeds. Easily grown indoors, it can be a good choice for newcomers to cannabis cultivation. Averaging 4.5 feet tall, the plants are bushy, with hearty, almost horizontal side branches. Anthos. Flowering happens within 8 to 10 weeks and the yield from this strain is higher than average, at about 37 to 56 grams (or 1.3 to 2 ounces). Because of its strong trademark aroma, an indoor growing environment with odor control is recommended.Hog’s trichome count rivals that of Afghani landrace strains, and breeder TH Seeds has used this heavy resin output to produce quality hash. This indica is a testament to the value of stabilized and organized commercial breeding.\n"

        "description": "Ingrid is a potent indica-dominant hybrid that’s slowly picking up traction as a potent way to treat pain and insomnia. This heavy bud is a cross between the notoriously pungent UK Cheese and classic indica Hash Plant. It offers mostly physically-focused effects, with the fringe benefit of quieting stress and loud mental chatter. The  squeamish should beware, as Ingrid has inherited all the stinkiness of both her parent strains. In any case, this bud’s THC content can’t be denied, clocking in at between 19% and 25%.Ingrid is marked by thick, spade-shaped nuggets that range in size from small to medium. These buds have the tight bud structure typically associated with indicas. The densely-packed leaves are a bright shade of lime green. Curly orange and brown pistils twist their way through this vivid greenery. Finally, a heavy coating of translucent white trichomes gives these flowers a dewy, wet appearance and a silvery sheen.Upon initial inspection of Ingrid’s flowers, the influence of UK Cheese is clear -- the buds give off an almost fermented, cheesy odor. This acrid scent is undercut by the mellow scent of damp earth and wood. Meanwhile, grinding up the dense buds yields some skunky, tangy notes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when combusted, Ingrid burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that that’s liable to make smokers’ eyes water. This funky smoke leaves behind a lingering taste of cheese and soil on the exhale. Ingrid’s dank odor can carry quite a distance -- smokers looking to maintain discretion should take any necessary precauations.Ingrid hits very quickly for an indica. Within short order, a throbbing of blood vessels in the face -- particularly around the eyes and temples -- will manifest as a sign of this strain’s potency. Soon thereafter, a psychedelic mindset may take over, with smokers’ sensory perception becoming gradually distorted. External stimuli like certain sounds or bright lights can seem more intense or interesting than they otherwise might; a sense of time dilation is also commonly reported. Users shouldn’t plan on getting a mountain of work accomplished after consuming this pungent bud. Instead, a dreamy, easily distractible mindset is likely to persist for hours. As such, Ingrid is great for spacing out with some atmospheric music or a mellow movie. The bud can also be a great way to end a long day or week of work, either alone or with some like-minded friends. It should come as no shock that couch lock is a frequent side effect, as is dry mouth. Because of its sleepy, low-energy vibes, Ingrid is best enjoyed after dark or just before bed.Ingrid’s relaxing properties can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The bud may dull pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to minor injury, or chronic, as due to nerve damage or conditions like lupus or arthritis. It can also provide temporary relief from the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Finally, Ingrid can act as a cure for insomnia -- in fact, budtenders at Colorado-based dispensary chain Good Chemistry recently touted the bud with cheeky t-shirts reading “Everyone sleeps with Ingrid.” Because it doesn’t often lead to the kind of intense, recursive thinking patterns that lead to paranoia, Ingrid is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Seeds of Ingrid do not appear to be available for sale online. As such, prospective home growers must obtain clippings from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical clones of the plant. Ingrid can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain flowers within a brief 5 to 7 weeks when grown indoors and offers a high yield of flowers. Finally, for those looking to keep their indoor growing operations under wraps, this can be a uniquely pungent crop that may call for odor-control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Although popular in West Coast markets, this bud’s strong sedative effects have it primed for a nationwide debut. Ingrid’s strong flavor profile and knockout effects insure that she’s a strain users won’t forget quickly.\n"

        "description": "Ostensibly named for the rollicking Queen song, Killer Queen is a well-balanced hybrid that’s “guaranteed to blow your mind.” Created in British Columbia, Canada, Killer Queen is a cross between psychedelic G13 and hybrid staple Cinderella 99. It is the brainchild of growing collective Brothers Grimm, the breeders responsible for Apollo 13 and Glass Slipper. This strain offers mostly head-focused effects and a universally appealing tropical flavor profile to boot, making great for both solo and social enjoyment. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 20%.Killer Queen shows off thick flowers that adhere in formations that range from cylindrical to spadelike, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. The buds have a typically dense indica structure, with their small leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves are a mossy shade of green and are twisted through with orange and brown hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants). Finally, Killer Queen’s buds are coated in crystalline white trichomes that, even from a distance, give off a silvery glimmer.When properly cured, Killer Queen has a predominantly sweet and tangy scent, redolent of oranges. As with parent strain Cinderella 99, there’s also a faint suggestion of pineapple, lending this bud a tropical character. Meanwhile, grinding up the dense buds releases some earthy and herbal notes, reminiscent of grandparent strain Jack Herer. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Killer Queen gives off a pleasantly sweet and smooth smoke. This soothing smoke tastes sweet and citrusy on the exhale.Killer Queen’s effects hit fast, initially manifesting as a concerted pressure around the eyes and forehead. Once smokers acclimate to this novel sensation, they may notice an increased capacity for deep, cerebral thinking. This kind of analytical acuity can be helpful for blowing through detail-oriented work or for accomplishing a mundane to-do list. In any case, smokers are typically able to maintain lucid thinking and to function in public if need be. In less productive circumstances, users can kick back and enjoy this bud’s heights of euphoria. Killer Queen can be particularly fun when shared with some like-minded friends, as it can inspire free-flowing conversation and facilitate camaraderie. As the bud’s effects wear on, a body high begins to creep in, creating a weighty feeling in the limbs and allowing users to breathe more deeply and easily. In these later stages, smokers may be tempted to seek out the closest comfortable surroundings and stretch out. Even if it manages to couchlock consumers, though, Killer Queen still allows for buzzy mental activity. Because of its taper down from cerebral energy into physical sedation, Killer Queen is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening; if toked right before bed, it’s likely to keep smokers awake and wired.Killer Queens can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its lasting feeling of focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on complicated tasks. This bud’s euphoric effects may temporarily improve symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Meanwhile, its physically numbing properties can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, as well as more mild afflictions like headaches and nausea. Because it can bring about intense, recursive patterns of thinking, Killer Queen is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately for home growers, Brother Grimm sells seeds of Killer Queen online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Because Killer Queen’s plants grow short and bushy, growers are encouraged to regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves that can prevent low-growing nodes from flowering. Growers should also provide staked supports for these heavy buds once flowering begins -- which is within 8 to 9 weeks when this strain is grown indoors. Finally, Killer Queen is said to offer a high than average yield of flowers at harvest time.Killer Queen’s versatile effects are enjoyable for both active and passive enjoyment. Pair it with some upbeat, buzzy music -- Queen is great, but anything will suffice.\n"

Users seek out Kong for its ability to soothe both body and mind, as well as its unique fruity and chemical bouquet. This bud also impresses with eye-catching, multicolored flowers. Kong’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 20%.With a name like Kong, you’d expect these flowers to be king-sized -- luckily, the strain delivers, with large, chunky buds that adhere in elongated, almost cylindrical formations. These nugs have a characteristically indica bud structure, thick and densely-packed. The leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Sometimes, Kong’s flowers are patched with deep blue and purple hues; these surprising colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics are activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, like King Kong himself, Kong is very hairy -- albeit in this case with fuzzy trichomes, making the buds particularly hard to break up without a quality grinder.When properly cured, Kong’s flowers bloom with a bright, lemony scent. On closer inspection, there’s also a slightly dank, vegetal character lurking underneath. Grinding up or breaking open these buds releases some surprisingly spicy, hashy notes. When combusted, Kong burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke that carries a citrus-tinged flavor on the exhale with some diesel fumes lingering on the palate.Kong hits quickly for an indica, enveloping the smoker with a close, warming sensation and exerting some blood pressure around the eyes and temples. For some, the force of this strain’s bodily relaxation can be disorienting at first. Once acclimated, though, smokers are typically able to ease into the high with a calm mind. Progressively, waves of relaxation spread down from the neck radiating out through the core and limbs -- so much so that this powerful bud is liable to lay newbies out flat with its lazy vibes. Kong also comes with some mental distortion, but any thoughts it inspires tend to be more spacey than cerebral and analytical. Some smokers also report feelings of sensory distortion, including the uncanny feeling of time passing more quickly or extremely slowly. As Kong can provoke giggles for some, it can prove useful for bringing about camaraderie in laid-back social situations. As this high progresses or as dosage is increased, couch lock becomes more and more likely, even for more experienced users. Under the right circumstances, Kong may lull consumers into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its almost narcotic effects, this is a strain best reserved for evening or nighttime use.Kong’s sedative effects may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can dull deep aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe irritations like indigestion and headaches. Psychologically speaking, Kong can temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. As noted, it can also counteract insomnia. Because this strain is unlikely to bring about the kind of obsessive thinking that leads to paranoia, it can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, Holy Smoke has made seeds of Kong available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate with daytime temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers should be sure to regularly “top” these squat and bushy crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out Kong’s vibrant blue and purple potential should expose their plants to nighttime temperatures at least 10 to 15 degrees below average just before flowering begins. Kong is ready for harvest within 6 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.Kong’s long-lasting sedation is a great excuse to spend a long rainy day indoors or a night on the couch. It deserves a spot in any heavy indica lover’s stash.\n"

        "description": "Lifesaver (or Life Saver) is an indica-dominant hybrid that lives up to its name in more ways than one. This bud offers a tart, candy-like fruit flavor alongside some invaluable therapeutic power. Lifesaver was created by inventive breeders BOG Seeds as a cross between their own BOG Bubble and JCB (which is itself a cross of Jack’s Cleaner and Blueberry). The result is a dynamically-flavored flower with lasting and balanced potency. Lifesaver’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 21%.Lifesaver makes it bag appeal clear right away with solid, almost spherical flowers. These buds are medium to large in size and cling together in the dense, thick bud structure that is characteristic of indica varieties. The tightly-coiled leaves are a mossy green and are threaded through with bright orange and yellow pistils. Occasionally, phenotypes of the strain also contain flashes of purple, ranging from pale lavender to a deep grape color; these hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments that become activated by cold weather in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. Finally, a dusting of translucent white trichomes covers these already-colorful flowers and accounts for their high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Lifesaver bursts with a fruity, berry-inflected aroma. On closer inspection, there are also some hints of lemon and grape. Meanwhile, grinding up or tearing apart these flowers yield some slightly herbal notes, speaking to the strain’s Jack Herer backbone. When burnt, Lifesaver gives off a smooth and easy smoke that tastes uniquely sweet and tart on the exhale. Those looking to keep their consumption discreet should take any needed precautions, as this strain can be a very pungent smoke.Lifesaver’s high takes hold quickly, conferring a pressure around the eyes and temples. This novel sensation is accompanied by a surge of emotional euphoria, as well as a distortion in sensory perception. Certain external stimuli can take on new intensity or dimensions. In addition to these mental phenomena, users will begin to detect powerful physical relaxation. Waves of numbing sedation spread throughout the body and pulverize any lingering muscular tension. Eventually, Lifesaver causes an uptick in cerebral activity -- thoughts may jump around in free association, but users are typically able to maintain a clear, lucid mindset and to carry on extended conversations with those around them. As such, this strain can be very social and giddy, bringing about camaraderie and good vibes when shared with like-minded friends. Lifesaver’s mental clarity may also be useful for accomplishing a pile of work, whether it’s analytical and task-based or more open-ended and creative. As the high wears on, it tapers off into full-on immobilization. There’s also a respective decline from cerebral energy into spacey daydreaming. Because of this decrescendo of effects, Lifesaver is best savored in the late afternoon or early evening.Lifesaver’s wide-reaching effects may also have application for medical cannabis patients. It can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on complicated jobs. Its easygoing nature may also temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Lifesaver can dull aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Meanwhile, its anti-inflammatory effects are beneficial for everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume Lifesaver with caution, as its sativa edge can bring about some paranoia in the wrong circumstances.Fortunately for home growers, BOG has made seeds of Lifesaver available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers should keep an eye out for any broad, light-block fan leaves, which can prevent light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. Lifesaver flowers within a short 6 to 7 weeks grown indoors and offers growers a solid yield for their efforts. Finally, just as this strain can be a pungent smoke, it can be a very pungent grow and may call for odor-control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans when cultivated indoors.A good all-purpose strain for indica and sativa lovers alike, Lifesavers is as enjoyable when consumed alone as it is when shared with friends.\n"

This perfectly balanced half indica, half sativa blend was bred by crossing Grapefruit and Super Silver Haze, giving users the highlight reel of both varieties. Born to a three-time first place Cannabis Cup winning mother, and a flavor legend father known the world over, it’s no wonder this bud packs such a heavy punch. The THC levels of Grapefruit Haze vary quite a bit, ranging anywhere from 16% - 25%, giving users a nice heady high that isn’t overwhelming. Little olive green and brown buds give off the smell of diesel and spice, while your taste buds will get a nice citrus and herbal flavor that lasts long after the smoke has cleared.  Grapefruit Haze offers users a cerebral happy high that comes in waves and lasts throughout the day.

Fret not novice users, this bud is recommended for users with all levels of experience. If you’d like to take a stab at growing this plant it is recommended for intermediate growers and those with a plethora of experience as it is a moderately difficult breed to cultivate. Look forward to a flowering time of 7 to 9 weeks for indoor growth or late October for outdoor environments. Grapefruit Haze will give you a yield that is above average in the right conditions.  For a high that lives up to the family name and will give you all of the body tingles you desire with none of the sleepy side effects, this is a great bud to try.

        "description": "Atomic Northern Lights is an indica-leaning strain whose dynamic and evocative name does a reasonably good job of describing its decidedly psychedelic effects. The strain has some storied genetics -- it is the product of staple indica Northern Lights, backcrossed with its own Thai Haze and Afghani landrace ancestors. As such, this highly stable bud carries a rich, hashy flavor and a potent, well-balanced high. The strain’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 14% and 24%.Atomic Northern Lights’ flowers are somewhat less impressive than the strain’s name would imply. The buds are typically small to medium in size and cling together in dense, popcorn-like clusters. They have a spade-like shape, tapering down into a pointed end, and have the tightly-packed bud structure characteristic of indica varieties. The leaves are a mossy green and contain a high volume of neon orange pistils. A coat of cloudy white trichomes gives the buds a sticky texture and accounts for their potency.When properly cured, flowers of Atomic Northern Lights have a musky, earthy scent, undercut by the woodsy odor of fresh pine. Grinding up or breaking open these dense buds releases some notes of hash and incense, speaking to the strong influence of Afghani. When the flowers are combusted, Atomic Northern Lights’ smoke tends to be harsh and acrid, stinging the eyes and sinuses. This smoke can taste simultaneously peppery and piney on the exhale.Atomic Northern Lights creeps on the smoker slowly, rather than hitting them like a bomb. Several minutes after savoring this strain’s rich taste, smokers begin to feel a concerted tingle in the neck and temples. At this point, sensory distortion is likely; bright lights or certain sounds can take on a new intensity or significance. These psychedelic effects pair well with a trippy album or a visually-engaging movie. This dreamy feeling soon melts into a full-body relaxation that crushes any stress and allows users to breathe more deeply and easily. Atomic Northern Lights also comes with a certain degree of mental stimulation, allowing smokers to engage in some intense cerebral thinking. Such a mindset allows for anything from introspective navel-gazing to efficient productivity. This engaged mood can also serve as a good way to spark conversation and inspired camaraderie in intimate social situations. Neither too buzzy nor too sedate, Atomic Northern Lights’ combination of effects is great for blowing off some steam at the end of a long day or week of work. Its mind/body balance is ideal for activities that involve both physical and mental acuity, like exercise and dancing. In the right set and setting, this bud can even be a strong aphrodisiac. Because of its buzzy onset, this strain is best enjoyed during the afternoon or early evening -- if consumed right before bed, it’s likely to keep users awake and wired.Atomic Northern Lights’ versatile effects can have many applications for medical cannabis patients. It can enable concentration and focus for those with attention deficit disorders. It can also soothe mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. The strain’s physically relaxing properties, meanwhile, can take care of deep-seated aches and pains, as well as more minor everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should moderate their intake of Atomic Northern Lights, as its cerebral edge has the potential to spiral into paranoia.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Atomic Northern Lights are available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and can be easily accommodated indoors. Growers should be sure to occasionally “top” their crops, cutting away broad fan leaves that might prevent light and air from nurturing any low-growing flowering nodes. Atomic Northern Lights flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors.A well-rounded hybrid, Atomic Northern Lights is a must-try for indica and sativa lovers alike. This magical strain is practically begging to be savored in the great outdoors -- bring it along on your next camping or hiking trip.\n"

        "description": "Grape Kush is a well-balanced hybrid with striking colors and a memorable flavor to match. This bud’s bag appeal is in part due to its powerful genetics. Created by Cali Connection -- purveyors of the “Alien” line, which includes Alien OG and Sour Alien -- Grape Kush is a cross between the ubiquitous Pre-98 Bubba Kush and flavorful indica hybrid Romulan Grapefruit. Grape Kush’s high is a well-balanced combination of mental distortion and physical relaxation. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of Grape Kush to have between 15% and a staggering 30% THC.Grape Kush’s flowers are more renowned for their color than for their size. When trimmed, these buds tend to be small to medium in size and hold a roughly spherical, popcorn-like shape. They have the dense formation usually associated with predominantly indica varieties. The leaves of these nuggets stand out, with almost equal proportions of green and deep purple, all twisted through with hairy, rust-colored pistils. These purple hues are the result of cold weather acting upon anthocyanin pigments in the bud’s genetics during the growing process. Finally, icy white trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these dense buds, accounting for their potent psychoactivity.When properly cured, Grape Kush’s flowers have the predominant aroma of tangy, sour grapes. Lingering underneath is a sweeter, berry-like character. Meanwhile, grinding up the solid buds yields the notes of dank earth and pine that make parent strain Bubba Kush so popular. When combusted, Grape Kush burns with a light, sweet smoke that is easily palatable to many consumers. This smoke has a simultaneously sweet and funky, sour taste on the exhale. Notably, the strong grape flavors associated with this strain are incidental to its purple coloring -- this is because the plant’s coloring is the result of pigments while its aroma is dictated by separate compounds called terpenes.Grape Kush hits the smoker quickly, conferring a head-focused high that begins as a prickling, tingly sensation around the eyes and upper face. Thoughts may take on a cloudy, dreamy character and jump around in a freely-associative manner. This change in thinking is accompanied by a stimulation of the senses -- sights and sounds may take on strange new dimensions, making trippy music or movies particularly fun during this phase of the high. Shortly after smokers have acclimated to this altered mindset, a profoundly relaxing body high creeps in. Waves of relaxation spread down from the neck and radiate out through the core, prompting many to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings. Grape Kush’s headrush is not particularly cerebral and therefore not very conducive to accomplishing tasks that require sustained concentration. As a result, productivity becomes even less likely as this strain’s deep, soothing body high sets in. Couchlock can be a real possibility as the high wears on, as can deep, intractable sleep. Grape Kush’s holistic, full-body effects make it a great way to relax after a long day or week of work, especially when shared with a group of like-minded friends. Because of its sleepy vibes, this strain is best reserved for nighttime (or even bedtime) consumption.Grape Kush can also have several benefits and applications for medical cannabis patients. Its mood-elevating properties can temporarily improve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress, depression, and even anxiety. Its physically numbing properties can also soothe deep, nerve-related aches and pains, as well as more minor annoyances like headaches and nausea. Finally, as noted, Grape Kush can be an effective antidote to difficult cases of insomnia. Because this strain is unlikely to bring about strong, recursive thinking and paranoia, it can be a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately, Cali Connection has made seeds of Grape Kush available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Per its breeders, Grape Kush can be a resilient plant that may withstand adverse conditions like unexpected temperature or moisture variations. This bud flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, Grape Kush can be a particularly pungent grow that may require discreet indoor growers to invest in odor-control measures like carbon air filters.Grape Kush’s versatile effects make it a must-try for indica and sativa lovers alike. If you opt to share this flavorful bud, be sure to bring enough, as its unique aroma is sure to turn some heads at parties.\n"

    "Green Lantern": {
        "name": "green-lantern",
        "effects": {},
        "description": "Green Lantern is a superhero of a strain with pronounced sativa effects but uncertain parentage. Some conjecture that it’s a relative recent cross between Green Crack and resinous White Rhino, while others speculate that this bud dates back to the heyday of its comic book namesake in the 1960s. Whatever its lineage, there’s no denying that Green Lantern offers a refreshing aroma and a long-lasting, head-focused high. Its THC content has been measured at between 14% and an impressive 28%.When trimmed, Green Lantern is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that cling together in a clustered, popcorn-like formation. These nugs hold a roughly spherical shape and, despite the strain’s sativa character, have the tight, dense bud structure common to predominantly indica varieties. Leaves are a pale shade of spring green, made even lighter by a blanket of sticky white trichomes. Finally, orange and yellow pistils twist their way through these hard and dense flowers.On initial inspection, flowers of Green Lantern burst with a pleasant blend of lemon and pine, not unlike some artificially-scented home cleaning products. There are also some dank notes of earth and pine lurking underneath these bright top notes. When this bud is ground up or broken apart, it yields chemical-tinged fumes, perhaps hinting at some degree of Sour Diesel in the mysterious strain’s genetics. Green Lantern’s smoke can be harsh and cough-inducing when it is burnt in a pipe or a joint. On the exhale, this acrid smoke tastes like pine with a dash of citrus funk.Unlike many other sativa strains, Green Lantern may take several minutes before revealing the extent of its effects. Eventually, however, smokers will begin to feel some mental stimulation that begins as a tingle around the eyes and temples. This sensation soon morphs into an increased awareness of one’s surroundings, including an intense experience of external stimuli -- certain sounds and colors can take on unexpected new dimensions. Users may also detect an improvement in mood, which in a properly relaxed set and setting can reach euphoric levels. Freely-associative patterns of thought are common, as is a newfound introspection. As such, Green Lantern is a great strain for savoring during some quality solo time. Alternatively, in social situations, this buzzy variety may make for some stimulating conversation and camaraderie. This bud’s uses are not exclusively recreation -- its lasting capacity for mental focus makes Green Lantern a resource for productivity when it comes to all kinds of work, both analytical and creative.  With very few physical effects and almost no danger of couchlock, this strain is an optimal choice for smokers who’d like to remain awake and active. Better in brightest day than in blackest night, Green Lantern is not a strain to enjoy right before bed, as it’s likely to keep users wired.Green Lantern’s buzzy mental effects can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its strong, unadulterated focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on complex tasks. Meanwhile, the bud’s upbeat, positive vibes may temporarily take the edge off of the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, some anti-inflammatory effects may relieve everyday irritations like indigestion and headaches. Because its intense, cerebral mindset may lend itself to paranoia, Green Lantern is not a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Since Green Lantern’s parentage and original breeders are unknown, seeds of the strain are not available for sale. As such, prospective growers should obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of this strain from a reliable source in order to grow genetically identical clones. The plants can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Because sativa-dominant strains can grow very tall, indoor growers should train their crops’ height by pruning back plants early on in the vegetative stage. There is no specific information available on flowering timelines for Green Lantern, but the strain’s strong sativa effects imply a long wait of at least 9 to 10 weeks before buds are ready for harvest.Green Lantern’s super sativa power is a must-try for experienced cannabis consumers who may be looking for a deep psychedelic experience. The strain can also be a good way to enhance buzzy daytime activities like running errands or even going for a jog.\n"

        "description": "With a searing cerebral high and a deep physical body stone, Ice Wreck’s dramatic name serves as an accurate description of its potent effects. This memorable strain is a combination of resinous Ice and landrace-descended Trainwreck. Created by Crop King Seeds, the prolific  breeders of strains like Candy Cane and Crown Royale, Ice Wreck offers a rich, earthy aroma alongside a simultaneously focused and luxuriously relaxing high. This bud’s THC content has been measured at between 18% and 28%.Ice Wreck is marked by small to medium flowers that do little to visually convey the strain’s power. These buds cling together in dense, clustered formations and hold roughly spherical shapes. They have the dense, solid structure associated with indica varieties. Leaves are a dark shade of olive green and are twisted through with vibrant orange hairs (which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, true to its name, Ice Wreck is covered in a thick, even blanket of translucent white trichomes, making these flowers very sticky and giving them an icy appearance even when viewed from afar.When properly cured, Ice Wreck’s flowers give off a fresh, woodsy pine scent. On closer inspection, there are also some dank notes of damp earthy. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the small buds gives off a rich perfume of incense and spice, perhaps testifying to the Afghani indica in this strain’s lineage. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Ice Wreck gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that may tickle the smoker’s palate and lungs, inducing tears and coughing. On the exhale, this rough smoke carries a piney, peppery flavor.Ice Wreck’s high takes effect quickly, exerting a pressure around the smoker’s eyes and temples scarcely before they’ve finished coughing. What follows is a suddenly cerebral mindset that can be good for the kind of freely-associative thinking that lends itself to both task-based analytical work as well as more freewheeling, creative brainstorming. Ice Wreck also brings a buzzy energy that’s great for accomplishing an afternoon’s worth of errands or a similarly mundane activity like cleaning. The strain’s strong cerebral nature, forcing smokers to spend time in their own heads, can be disorienting for the uninitiated. In the right set and setting, though, this energy can be uniquely lucid and even social, provoking conversation and good vibes when shared with like-minded friends.As the high progresses, a progressive body stone sets in, pulverizing any pervasive muscular tension while allowing users to breathe more deeply and easily. This mellow indica onset can take the edge off of the strain’s initially cerebral properties, allowing smokers to kick back and chill out. Ice Wreck is unlikely to become totally incapacitating, though. Instead, its eventual blend of mental and physical stimulation can be a great way to enhance activities that involve both brain and body coordination, like exercise, video games, and even sex. Because of its decrescendo down from energy into subtle relaxation, Ice Wreck is recommended for late afternoon to early evening use.This bud’s versatile effects can have wide-ranging applications for medical cannabis patients. Its upbeat, energetic properties may temporarily relieve the troubling symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Its lasting sense of focus can also be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. Meanwhile, Ice Wreck’s physically relaxing properties may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Because its early effects can be mentally fast-paced and disorienting, this strain is not a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Ice Wreck are available for sale online. Considered a moderately difficult grow, it can be successfully cultivated indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Ice Wreck’s sativa genetics are apparent in its long, 10-week flowering time. When mature, it offers a low to average yield of flowers.Ice Wreck’s balance makes it a good all-purpose smoke for experienced consumers with a baseline THC tolerance. The strain’s high trichome count may also be useful in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

They are often mistaken for weeds when cared for outdoors as the plant is quite bushy and light green. Indoor growing is recommended for less experienced growers, however, because of the diesel aroma, you may want to invest in a smell proof setup. The nugs will appear ready for harvest at around 7 weeks, however, you’ll want to hold off until 8 weeks for the fully formed trichomes to appear. Your yield will increase dramatically during that extra week as well. If you’re a fan of its parents, you won’t be disappointed with Green Hornet. With a full body of flavors, aromas, and colors, it’s pleasurable to all of your senses. The giggly and upbeat high is great for any time of day and the sharp as a tack focus is beneficial for anyone wanting a productive high.\n"

This sativa-dominant hybrid is the brainchild of Mr. Nice Seeds, the Netherlands-based creators of Super Silver Haze, and is a cross between Northern Lights #5, Skunk, and Haze. The complex genetic combination results in a refreshing tropical aroma alongside a strong, dreamlike high. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 measures Mango Haze’s potency at between 9% to 19% THC.Mango Haze makes its bag appeal clear right away with large, elongated buds. These flowers have an extended spadelike shape, somewhat like oversized pinecones. The leaves are in keeping with a characteristically sativa bud structure -- they appear loose and piecey and can be easily torn away from their central stems. These soft, fluffy leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are threaded through with hairy yellow and orange pistils. Translucent amber trichomes cover all surfaces of these leaves, giving the flowers a slightly golden sheen.When properly cured, flowers of Mango Haze burst with a strong citrus scent. Distinct notes of mango prevail, along with a skunky-sweet, almost fermented odor. When Mango Haze’s flowers are ground up, they give off a rich and spicy incense, likely passed on from the Afghani landrace in parent strain Northern Lights’ background. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Mango Haze gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke that tastes both sweet and hashy on the exhale.Mango Haze offers a slow, creeping high that may take several minutes after consumption to reveal its trippy effects. Eventually, smokers will begin to feel a concerted pressure around the eyes and forehead. As they adjust to this odd sensation, they may pick up on changes to their sensory perception, including an amplified awareness of certain sights and sounds; a strange feeling of time dilation is also commonly reported. Parent strain Haze is notorious for imparting a strong, dreamy head high. This mindset can spark rambling, free-flowing creativity that can be great for brainstorming but not as good for more task-based analytical work. In the right set and setting, Mango Haze can also trigger some mellow introspection. For the consumer in a more active mood, Mango Haze provides the energy needed to illuminate daily tasks like cleaning the house or running errands.As this high progresses, some subtle indica effects creep in on the backend, numbing any bodily tension and allowing for deep, easy breathing. Such a mindset can help smokers melt into their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background. Although it’s unlikely to completely knock users out with couchlock, Mango Haze can help to quell any internal mental or physical stress. Because it tapers down into a smooth, downbeat high, Mango Haze is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening.Mango Haze’s even-handed effects can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s mood-elevating properties can temporarily take the edge off of stress and depression. Meanwhile, its subtle physical high can provide mild relief from deep-seated aches and pains, as well as everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it is unlikely to bring about the kind of intense, recursive thinking patterns that lead to paranoia, Mango Haze may be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Mr. Nice has made seeds of Mango Haze available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This sativa’s plants can grow tall, reaching heights of up to 6 feet; as such, indoor growers should control the height of their crops by trimming back branches early on in the vegetative stage. Like many other indica-leaning varieties, Mango Haze has a long flowering time -- in this case about 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors. At harvest time, the strain offers patients growers a yield of about 42 to 51 grams (or 1.5 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.A pleasant combination of mental and physical effects, Mango Haze is a good example of a strain that doesn’t sacrifice flavor for potency. For those seeking a more therapeutic high, there’s also a CBD-rich variety of Mango Haze available.\n"

        "description": "Watermelon, also known as Watermelon Kush, is a mysterious strain of unknown parentage. This bud’s unspecified genetic background brings a rich mix of terpenes that have resulted in a unique watermelon aroma. Beyond its refreshing summery flavor, this strain is valued for its long-lasting sedative power. Watermelon’s THC content has been measured at between 11% and 22%.Watermelon is marked by large, chunky flowers that tend to maintain their shape when trimmed. These buds adhere in the relatively loose, piecey structure usually associated with sativa varieties. The fluffy leaves, which can easily be torn away from their central stems, are a bright shade of yellowish green. These flowers are also filled with curly orange hairs (which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from from fertilizing male plants. Capping off the impressive buds is a thick blanket of trichomes that gives them a white sheen and a very sticky texture.If properly cured, Watermelon’s flowers give off a fruity aroma that blends tart berries and grape. While present, the strain’s watermelon scent is not especially prominent and may only be detected on a second or third inspection. Grinding up these buds yields some skunky notes, perhaps testifying to OG Kush in the strain’s lineage. When combusted, Watermelon burns with a smooth, fruity smoke that tastes like grape with some lingering sour traces on the exhale.As with many predominantly indica strains, Watermelon’s high has a slow onset. The effects may begin as a tingle around the eyes and forehead. This odd sensation soon warps into a warm feeling that envelops the entire body, letting users know that they’re in for a physically relaxing experience.Watermelon is not without some mental stimulation, though. Although this is a heavy indica, it comes without the dopey, incapacitated mindset of some stronger, knockout indica strains. Smokers may notice their thoughts rambling freely, and may find some concepts or stimuli to be more interesting than they otherwise might. Although Watermelon is unlikely to facilitate any deep, cerebral thinking, it’s just the thing for a creative brainstorm or for simple, idle daydreaming. While consumers typically remain lucid enough to carry on conversations, those with a busy schedule shouldn’t plan on getting any work done under Watermelon’s influence. Instead, this bud is a good accompaniment to kicking back and watching tv and the end of a long day or week of work. As the high passes or as dosage is increased, users should prepare for some intractable couchlock. Under the right circumstances, the strain can even lull smokers into a deep, restful sleep. Because of its mostly sedative vibes, this strain is recommended for nighttime rather than daylight use.Watermelon can also have several potential benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its physically soothing effects can treat aches and pains, whether they’re temporary or chronic. It may also soothe everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Meanwhile, the bud’s mood-elevating properties may temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Finally, as noted, Watermelon can counteract insomnia with the force of its sedation. Because this strain is unlikely to trigger the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, it is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No breeders have taken the reins of cultivating Watermelon on a commercial scale. As such, seeds are not readily available online and prospective growers will need to obtain clippings of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Watermelon flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers grows a high yield of flowers for their efforts.Somewhat difficult to come by, Watermelon is worth snatching up if spotted on dispensary shelves. If you bring this bud out in social situations, its irresistible fruity aroma is sure to turn some heads -- so be sure to bring enough to share.\n"

        "description": "White Girl is a rare hybrid that crosses staple Girl Scout Cookies and flavorful Berry White. Unlike the narrowly-marketed “White Girl Rosé” line of wine products, however, this strain is named for the high volume of white trichomes that covers its dense flowers. White Girl offers consumers a tangy, fruity flavor and a sativa-leaning high that’s sure to be impressive to novice and veteran cannabis consumers like. This bud’s THC content has been measured at between 13% and a staggering 30%.White Girl tends to have small flowers that cling together in dense globular forms like so many pieces of popcorn. These nuggets have a tight, dense bud structure, with the leaves curling tightly inward. These leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted though with hairy orange pistils. Finally, true to its name, White Girl has inherited parent strain Berry White’s capacity for trichomes production and is packed with cloudy white trichomes.When properly cured, the predominant aroma that wafts up from White Girl’s buds is that of tart berry. On closer inspection, there are also some dank, earthy notes reminiscent of parent strain Girl Scout Cookies. Meanwhile, grinding up these tightly-packed flowers gives off a rich, earthy odor like fresh-cut wood. White Girl burns with a harsh, acrid smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. If they aren’t coughing too hard from an initial toke, smokers may be able to pick up on some fruity, skunky flavors on the exhale.White Girl’s effects come on strong with buzzy, stimulating effects. Soon after smoking, consumers may notice a pressure, verging on a twitch, around the eyes and temples. Once acclimated to this odd sensation, they typically detect a large increase in cerebral functioning, with thoughts jumping rapidly from one to the next. This sudden feeling of “mindrace” is marked by a fascination with objects or concepts that might be otherwise uninteresting. Cannabis newbies may also be lucky enough to experience some strong, trippy feelings of sensory distortion -- certain sights or sounds may take on a new intensity or dimensions; the phenomenon of time dilation is also commonly reported. Because of its ability to sustain concentration, this cerebral high can be great for accomplishing detailed, task-based work. It can also improve mundane everyday chores like cleaning the house or running errands.  As this mentally bracing high wears on, a mild body high sets in. Although relaxing, this sense of physical calm is not nearly strong enough to incapacitate smokers. Instead, it may take the edge off of White Girl’s strong cerebral edge, paving the way for some easy socializing. Because it is more stimulating than yrelaxing, White Girl is recommended for daytime (and even wake-and-bake) enjoyment; if consumed before bed, it’s likely to keep smokers wired and wide awake.White Girl’s active effects can also have some usefulness for medical cannabis patients. Its lucidity and focus may boost concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. The strain can also help those suffering from mild to moderate stress and depression to spend their time more presently and consciously. Some anti-inflammatory effects can also relieve minor, everyday pain like headaches and nausea. Because its intense patterns of thought can easily veer into paranoid territory, White Girl is not recommended for those who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.No commercial-scale breeders have claimed responsibility for White Girl’s creation and seeds of the strain do not appear to be widely available online. As such, prospective home growers must obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Like most hybrids, White Girl can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivations calls for a climate with partial humidity and daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain’s sativa characteristics suggest that plants can become particularly tall -- indoors growers should cut back their crops early in the vegetative stage in order to train their height.Somewhat difficult to come by, White Girl is worth sampling for its buzzy, wide-eyed effects. It can be a potent addition to both solo and social pursuits.\n"

It is a cross between sativa favorite Chemdawg and infamous stoner Willie Nelson’s eponymous sativa strain. The result is a high-powered sativa with a unique, well-rounded flavor. Chem Willie’s buzzy effects are said to last longer than average, even for frequent smokers. This bud’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and a whopping 31%.Chem Willie is distinguished by its small to medium-sized buds that hold a tapering, spadelike shape. The flowers adhere in a relatively loose, sativa-typical structure, with the fluffy leaves clinging loosely to their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark green, with patches of brighter neon green peppered throughout. Hairy, rust-colored pistils cling to these piecey leaves and sticky translucent trichomes cover all surfaces.This strain’s predominant scent is bright and tangy, with some sour citrusy notes. Complementing this fruitiness is a more herbal undertone, reminiscent of sage. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart Chem Willie’s leafy flowers yield a pervasive odor of skunk. When Chem Willie is combusted in a pipe or a joint, it burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes like a pleasant combination of orange zest and spice on the exhale. Smokers looking to maintain discretion should take any necessary precautions, as Chem Willie can be a particularly pungent smoke.The high from this strain takes hold right away, with a quick head rush. If smokers are sitting, they may feel some mild dizziness when standing up again. In addition to this slight vertigo, Chem Willie imparts some initial tingling around the eyes and temples. Once this sensation passes, users are hit with a surge of energy, along with feelings of power and euphoria. This empowering effect can manifest as a cerebral tendency to apply complex analytical thinking to tasks and situations. Alternatively, Chem Willie may inspire more physically-inclined users to get up and exercise or to accomplish a long list of mundane chores. However consumers choose to employ their high, they tend to experience freely-associative patterns of thought that may jump from one topic to the next. This kind of mindrace can be right at home in buzzy social situations, where it can inspire free-flowing conversations and create a feeling of camaraderie.This bud comes with very few physical effects. Smokers may only feel slight relaxation in the form of decreased muscular tension and an increased capacity for deep, even breathing. Because it is more likely to keep consumers awake and moving than couchlocked and sleepy, Chem Willie is recommended for daytime (and even morning) use.Chem Willie’s alert effects can have many applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sustained feeling of concentration can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. The bud may also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Chem Willie can relieve everyday annoyances like indigestion and headaches. Because its sense of mindrace can be disorienting and may lead to paranoia, this strain is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Chem Willie do not seem to be produced on a commercial scale for sale online. Prospective growers should seek out trusted breeders in order to obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. This bud’s sativa lineage suggests tall plants that may need to be pruned back in order to be trained to fit indoors. Because it’s a sativa, Chem Willie likely also has a long flowering time of at least 9 and up to 11 weeks when grown indoors. Finally, just as it can be a pungent smoke, Chem Willie can be a very pungent grow -- indoor growers should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.With versatile effects, Chem Willie is a must-try for sativa lovers and for Willie Nelson fans of any stripe. It’s a good option for solo enjoyment or for buzzy social use.\n"

This bud’s well-balanced high can complement a variety of activities while its long-lasting potency is sure to appeal to cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. Pie Face’s moderate THC content has been measured at between 16% and 19%.Pie Face is marked by solid medium to large-sized buds. These flowers have a slightly elongated silhouette and a spadelike shape, tapering down from a broad base to a pointed end. The fragrant nuggets cling together in a dense, indica-typical bud structure, with their leaves coiled tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are theaded through with dark, rust-colored pistils. Finally, a profusion of cloudy white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these thick buds, giving them a sticky texture and accounting for their high psychoactivity.On initial inspection, Pie Face’s flowers seem to have inherited parent strain Cherry Pie’s bright cherry aroma. Hanging underneath are some herbal and floral notes that have an almost medicinal character. Meanwhile, grinding up these buds gives off a pungent skunky odor. Burning Pie Face’s flowers results in a smooth, pleasant smoke. This smoke tastes simultaneously fruity and herbal on the exhale.Pie Face offers a creeper of a high, taking as long as 15 minutes after smokers have savored its flavor before revealing its effects. Users may eventually notice a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples, along with a surge in euphoria. As they adjust to this new frame of mind, consumers may begin to notice some strange changes in sensory perception -- certain sights or sounds may take on a new intensity and depth perception may become notably impaired or distorted. If not too overwhelmed by these trippy phenomena, smokers can seize upon an uptick in cerebral thinking. Thoughts may jump from one to the next with speed and confidence. As such, Pie Face can be a very social and talkative way to unwind after a long day or week of work. Alternatively, the bud’s sense of focus can enhance solo efforts at work-based productivity, whether the work in question is analytical and task-based or more freewheeling and creative.As the high wears on, Pie Face’s indica side kicks in, melting across the smoker’s body like a pie to the face. Although not overpowering or couchlocking, this physical relaxation is enough to mellow out any previously agitated mindset and put consumers at peace with their surroundings. The eventual combination of mental and physical effects makes the strain a good way to tackle activities that involve both mind and body, including exercise, video games, and even sex. Due to its taper from energetic mental stimulation down into physical relaxation, Pie Face is best consumed during the late afternoon and early evening.Pie Face’s effects can also have applications for medical cannabis patients.

Physiologically speaking, Pie Face’s physical effects can soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus and fibromyalgia. Pie Face can also stimulate the appetite, and may make smokers seek out a savory treat from the Australian meat pie company of the same name. Because its onset is associated with strong, recursive thinking, Pie Face is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Archive Seeds have made seeds of Pie Face available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

The result is a deeply flavorful bud that offers potent and long-lasting effects.Flowers of Royal Dutch are typically dense and tightly-packed with dark, forest-green leaves. These buds are twisted through with hairy orange pistils and are topped off with a crown of translucent white trichomes. When properly cured, these buds carry a complex scent that is predominantly rich and hashy like its Pakistani Kush parent strain. There are also some notes of spice and pine passed on from its South African side. When combusted, Royal Dutch burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may tickle the lungs and induce coughing for some. This smoke some has an earthy, piney flavor on the exhale.The high from Royal Dutch begins with a quick cerebral surge. In addition to a distorted perception of external stimuli, smokers may notice a change in their patterns thinking, with thoughts jumping from one to the next.

Popular in West Coast cannabis markets and used to spin off crossbreeds like tasty Purple Jolly Rancher, this bud’s own lineage is shrouded in mystery. Whatever its backstory, though, Jolly Rancher is notable for its tart and fruity flavor, as well as its subtly stimulating high. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 11% and 20%.Jolly Rancher’s flowers catch the eye with their size and cohesion. The medium to large buds hold together in a tapered, spadelike shape. The densely-packed leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a drab shade of olive green, although may phenotypes are also streaked with hues of red and purple -- such vibrant colors come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the plant’s genetics are activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, capping off these colorful flowers is a tangle of hairy orange and red pistils, as well as a dusting of cloudy white trichomes.Jolly Rancher offers a complex, multi-faceted odor when properly cured. The flowers may smell sweet at first, but successive sniffing may reveal some more sour, possibly unpleasant notes. Grinding up these dense buds gives off pungent fumes of skunk and diesel, possibly hinting at Sour Diesel in Jolly Rancher’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, these flowers burn with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes like sour berries with a slight hint of grape on the exhale. Notably, Jolly Rancher’s grape flavor is coincidental to its purple coloring -- this is because the strains’ aroma is determined by terpenes, chemical compounds that are distinct from its pigmentation.Jolly Rancher offers a slow, creeping high that may take as many as 10 or 15 minutes before revealing its mind-warping effects. The strain’s sativa side emerges first, boosting analytical thinking; some users may feel as if they’re able to step back and observe the progression of their own thoughts. Such free association makes Jolly Rancher a great way to power through both analytical and creative work. Similarly, this bud can clear the cobwebs out of a stuck or a troubled mind. Smokers typically find that they’re able to function as they ordinarily would, free to converse and to engage in physical activity if so desired. Be warned, though, that Jolly Rancher’s indica effects reveal themselves as the high progresses. These qualities manifest as a slow, sinking feeling of relaxation that may inspired previously active smokers to lounge in the closest comfortable surroundings. This sedation is unlikely to lead to couchlock, but it’s a peaceful way to unwind with a soothing movie or with some trippy, atmospheric music. Alternatively, Jolly Rancher’ relaxed and open-minded vibes can facilitate camaraderie and free-flowing conversation when shared with like-minded friends. Best consumed during the daytime through late afternoon, Jolly Rancher is an excellent wake-and-bake treat.Despite its playful name, Jolly Rancher can also be of value to medical cannabis patients. The bud’s lucid, clear-eyed concentration can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. Mood-elevating effects may also temporarily improve the symptoms of stress and depression. Meanwhile, Jolly Rancher’s physically numbing properties can alleviate all kinds of aches and pains, whether temporary or chronic. Patients who are prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume Jolly Rancher with caution, as its cerebral effects may prove overwhelming for some.Since no breeders have yet produced Jolly Rancher on a commercial scale, prospective home growers must obtain clippings from mature plants in order to grow clones. While there is little information available on specific best practices for cultivating this strain, we know that, like many hybrids, it can successfully grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Furthermore, growers looking to bring out the bud’s iridescent red and purple hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average just before flowering begins. Finally, Jolly Rancher can be a pungently skunky plant to grow; discreet home growers may want to invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.With wide-reaching effects, Jolly Rancher is a solid strain for sativa and indica lovers alike. As it grows in popularity, we’ll be watching to see if it stirs up any controversy, as its tasty name could potentially appeal to children.\n"

        "description": "Nurse Jackie is a mostly sativa hybrid with an exceptionally strong herbal flavor. Named after the troubled emergency room nurse portrayed by Edie Falco on Showtime, Nurse Jackie offers long-lasting cerebral effects. This strain was created by Pacific Northwest-based Homegrown Natural Wonders as a cross between pungent Jack the Ripper and potent Medicine Woman. Despite its namesake’s fondness for prescription opioids, this bud renders such drugs unnecessary, calming both the mind and the body. Nurse Jackie’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 24%.Nurse Jackie’s flowers tend to take two distinct shapes: some are rounded, almost spherical buds, while others form as elongated, spindly blossoms. In either case, the flowers have a characteristically sativa bud structure, with fluffy, loose leaves that can be easily torn away from their central stems. These leaves are a bluish green -- almost like sage -- and are twisted through with hairy orange pistils. Cloudy amber trichomes also dot the leaves, giving them a yellowish hue and making them particularly sticky.When properly cured, Nurse Jackie gives off an unmistakable lemon scent that fills the nostrils. On closer inspection, there are also notes of pine and herbs, which mix with the strain’s lemon aroma to create the impression of a cup of herbal tea. Grinding up these fluffy buds yields some strong, ammonia-tinged fumes. When burnt and inhaled, Nurse Jackie may be harsh and acrid, triggering watery eyes or coughing fits. On the exhale, though, this smoke tastes like a pleasant combination of earthy pine and citrus.Nurse Jackie’s tenacious high hits quickly, exerting a pressure on the blood vessels around the smoker’s eyes and forehead. After adjusting to this sensation, users may also notice an elevated heart rate, along with a rapid improvement in mood. Those lucky enough to tap into this bud’s euphoric effects may find that any prior stresses seem temporarily irrelevant under the weight of Nurse Jackie’s positive vibes. Besides creating a general sense of well-being, this strain also does a good deal of mental stimulation. It can spark new patterns of cerebral thinking, causing thoughts to flow from one to the next in rapid succession. Some may find this feeling of “mindrace” disorienting, but in the right set and setting, it can be just the thing to open up new pathways of creativity. As such, Nurse Jackie is great for task-based work, as well as for more introspective acts of self-edification. In a solo setting, simply clear your mind and kick back with some dynamic music or an engaging movie or documentary. This strain’s upbeat energy can also be uniquely social, especially if you’re surrounded by chatty friends. With very few of the sleepy, groggy effects that come with more indica-inflected strains, Nurse Jackie isn’t liable to lay its users out flat with couchlock. This strain is best consumed during the day, or whenever smokers are most active; if enjoyed before bed, it’s likely to keep users awake and wired.It almost goes without saying that a strain dubbed Nurse Jackie has value for medical cannabis patients as well. The strain can help those with mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more presently and consciously. Despite a lack of physical stimulation, it may also soothe pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. The bud’s anti-inflammatory properties may take care of everyday irritations like headaches or nausea. Because its intense, recursive patterns of thinking may lead to paranoia, Nurse Jackie is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Homegrown Natural Wonders has made seeds of Nurse Jackie available through several digital retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As with many sativas, Nurse Jackie’s plants can grow very tall; indoor growers should trim back their crops early on in order to train them to fit in limited spaces. Nurse Jackie flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.Whether you’re using it to medicate or to simply enhance an afternoon, Nurse Jackie is a potent and valuable sativa. It’s somewhat difficult to come by outside of the U.S. West Coast -- snatch it up if you spot it at a dispensary near you.\n"

ReCon’s name refers in part to its genetics -- it is descended from powerhouse hybrid LA Confidential. Cannadential is its other parent strain, imparting some aromatic funk. Recon is the brainchild of DNA Genetics, the creator of strains like Holy Grail and Chocolope. Sure to impress cannabis newbies and veterans alike, Recon’s sedative effects are said to last longer than average. This bud’s psychoactivity has been quantified at between 13% and 23% THC.Recon’s flowers tend toward the smaller side and cling together in dense, popcorn-like formations. The buds are rounded and have the densely-packed structure most often association with indicas. The mossy green leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems and are threaded through with dark, rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally,  blanket of icy white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these dense flowers, making them very sticky and difficult to break apart without a quality grinder.On initial inspection, Recon’s flowers hit the nose with the sharp scent of pepper and cloves. Examining the buds more closely reveals an underlying sweetness that verges on a dank, almost fermented musk. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open these tight buds yields subtle herbal notes. When Recon is combusted in a pipe or a joint, it gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that can irritate the smoker’s eyes or sinuses. This thick, rich smoke tastes sweet and hashy on the exhale.Recon has a high that hits quickly for an indica. Almost immediately, a calm, melting sensation spreads down from the neck and outward through the core and limbs. Depending on the user’s set and setting as well as their individual tolerance, this numbing sensation may progress toward pseudo paralysis. Many consumers also report a trippy feeling of sensory distortion -- this phenomenon can manifest as anything from an impaired visual depth perception to an intensification of sights and sounds to misleading sense of time dilation. If you’re so inclined, revel in these psychedelic effects by kicking back alone with some atmospheric music or an intense, engaging movie. This one-sided strain comes with little to no mental stimulation (unless you count the foggy, disoriented feeling that comes with the force of Recon’s physical high). As such, smokers shouldn’t plan on accomplishing a mountain of work while under Recon’s spell. Instead, enjoy this bud as a way to enhance small, laid-back gatherings or to spark a little intimacy and romance. As the high progresses or as dosage  is increased, smokers can count on intractable couchlock -- and even sleep. Because of its purely relaxing and immobilizing character, Recon is one strain best enjoyed at night or just before bed.Recon may several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its thorough physical relaxation can be a great analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as in the case of injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The strain’s anti-inflammatory effects can also relieve everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Psychologically speaking, Recon’s smooth, uplifting high may temporarily take the edge off of the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. As noted, in high enough doses, this strain can even induce a deep and restful sleep. Because it is unlikely to bring about any overly intense patterns of thinking, Recon may be a good option for those who are prone to anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, DNA Genetics has made seeds of Recon available for sale online. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Recon’s plants have a characteristically short and bushy indica silhouette, and growers should regularly trim away any broad fan-leaves that might block light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. Recon flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September to early October when grown outdoors.With a spacey, relaxing high and a bold, memorable flavor, Recon deserves a spot in any indica lover’s stash box.\n"

        "description": "Country music legend and weed advocate Willie  Nelson has inspired several varieties of cannabis. Red Headed Stranger is one such bold sativa that pays tribute to the singer’s 1975 album of the same name. This strain’s buzzy, head-focused effects melt into physical relaxation on the backend. Although its original breeders are unknown, Red Headed Stranger is a cross between ubiquitous sativa Haze and Willy’s Wonder, also named in Nelson’s honor. This strain’s well-balanced effects come alongside a strong and spicy flavor profile. Red Headed Stranger’s potency has been measured at between 16% and 26% THC.Red Headed Stranger is marked by small flowers that tend to adhere in pebbly clusters. Despite a mostly sativa background, these buds have the tight, densely-packed structure more often associated with indicas. The tightly-curled leaves a dark shade of forest green. True to its name, Red Headed Stranger is filled with curly red and orange hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, a profusion of cloudy white trichomes covers the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these flowers, accounting for their sky-high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Red Headed Stranger carries a predominantly citrus smell, redolent of fresh orange zest. Hanging underneath is a spicy, peppery character likely passed on from pungent parent strain Haze. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields hashy, incense-like notes that are a testament to the Afghani landrace genes in parent strain Willie’s Wonder’s background. When combusted, Red Headed Stranger burns with a strong, acrid smoke that may cause the smoker’s eyes to water. This pungent smoke tastes simultaneously sweet and spicy on the exhale.Red Headed Stranger’s effects hit quickly, creating a buzzing pressure around the temples and forehead. This novel sensation is soon accompanied by a change in sensory perception -- certain external stimuli may strike the smoker as more dynamic or intense than they otherwise might. Once they’ve adjusted to these phenomena, smokers may also notice an uptick in their cerebral patterns of thinking, with ideas and concepts jumping from one to the next in rapid succession. Although their thoughts may be flying high, Red Headed Stranger allows smokers to remain fully grounded and aware of their surroundings. This functional, thoughtful high is a great way to accomplish work, whether it’s analytical or more creative and open-ended. Red Headed Stranger can also be a fun way to enhance annoying everyday activities like cleaning or running errands. As time passes or as dosage is increased, some therapeutic relaxation may creep in. This sedation can be detected as a weightiness in the limbs and extremities; users may also find themselves able to breathe more deeply and easily. Because of this taper down from energy into relaxation, Red Headed Stranger is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening.Red Headed Stranger can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its clear-eyed concentration can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. Its stimulation can help alleviate the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, this strain’s subtle physical effects can soothe deep-seated aches and pains as well as everyday irritations like headaches. Because its fast-paced thinking can often veer into paranoia, Red Headed Stranger is not recommended for patients who are prone to anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Since no breeders have made seeds of Red Headed Stranger available on a commercial scale, prospective growers must obtain clippings of mature plants from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.”  The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoor calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Although there is limited information available on best practices for growing this specific strain, its thick indica-inflected flowers suggest that its plants grow short and bushy. As such, growers should regularly trim away any broad fan leaves that might prevent light and air from nurturing any low-growing flowering nodes.Whether you’re a ginger, a Willie Nelson fan, both, or neither, Red Headed Stranger is worth trying for its excellent balance of mental and physical effects. Very popular in Colorado, the strain is poised to take over other emerging cannabis markets.\n"

        "description": "This well-balanced hybrid comes from two long-time favorites: Green Crack and Purple Kush. With parentage like that, you are surely in for an experience, and Green Kush doesn’t disappoint. Enjoy this heavy hitting high before bed or after dinner to maximize the desired effect. With THC levels often in the low to mid 20’s, you’ll be sure to get a high that’s worthy of your time. These medium-sized, deep green nugs give off a refreshing pine aroma with undertones of citrus and earth for a full-bodied aroma. On the inhale you’ll experience more of the citrus flavor and the coolness of the pine, while on your exhale the flavors round out with a bit of spice, perfect for a chilly night in. The cerebral high that comes with Green Kush is fast acting and will rush over your whole body after the first hit. As you let that sink in a heavy tingle will take effect, leaving you with complete relaxation. Full body sedation will last around two hours, being replaced by one of two opposites: sleep or energy. Some users have experienced complete comatose-like sleep while others express a desire to get up and move. For medicinal users, this product is perfect for mild pain, muscle spasms, and headaches due to its sedative properties. It aids in releasing tension and is highly recommended by other users for this specific purpose. If you’re suffering from depression or stress this strain can be beneficial to many because of its uptick in energy toward the middle of the high. Novice users should be aware that this is a heavy high, and to proceed with caution. Growing this plant is fairly easy, though the yield is moderate whether you do it inside or outside. You can expect a flowering period of 8 to 9 weeks, with dark green or mint colored nugs containing little brown hairs as a nice accent. The plants are particularly fickle so starting one from seed can be a bit tricky, which is why Green Kush is often recommended for more intermediate to experienced growers. Because this high can go one of two ways, definitely take a swing at this after you’ve finished all your pressing tasks for the day. If you love an energetic high, if you love a deep body high, or if you love to end your high with a nice long nap, this one has something for everyone and can be enjoyed by smokers of all experience levels.\n"

        "description": "With a name like Remedy, this stain sets some high expectations for its ability to soothe a variety of ailments. Luckily for consumers, Remedy delivers, granting deep and lasting pain relief. Remedy (aka Z7) was created by medically-focused breeders CBD Crew as a cross between luxuriously relaxing Cannatonic and pungent landrace descendant Afghan Skunk. This bud is notable for its relative lack of psychoactive effects -- rather than THC, it is bred for high concentrations of the cannabinoid CBD, which does more to medicate the body than to warp the mind. As such, Remedy is a great option for medical cannabis patients who’d prefer not to get “high” in the traditional sense -- although some phenotypes of Remedy do have a slightly higher ratio of THC. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found Remedy to have between 12% to 16% CBD and 0.7% to 1% THC.Remedy is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that adhere in pronounced spadelike shape, tapering down from a broad broad base into a pointed tip. These buds have the dense, tightly-packed structure usually associated with high-THC indica strains. The curling leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with vibrant yellow pistils. A coating of translucent amber trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these leaves, giving them a slightly yellow sheen.When properly cured, Remedy gives off a woody, natural scent that may remind some of a seasonal bonfire. These buds also have an earthy odor similar to musk or damp soil. Grinding the flowers up or breaking them apart yields notes of pine. Despite such a rich, heavy aroma, Remedy burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke has an earthy flavor on the exhale, enhanced by a hint of lemon.Remedy’s effects set in slowly and, because they are physically therapeutic, may be difficult for a frequent smoker of more psychoactive, recreational strains to appreciate. Within several minutes, the user feels blanketed by relaxation. Along with a capacity for deep, restorative breathing, Remedy brings a dulling effect to any stress, whether physical or mental. This sedation is blessedly free of the fast-paced mindrace or the disorienting depersonalization that can come with high THC strains. If it has any recreational utility, Remedy is good for some solo unwinding in the most comfortable possible surroundings after a long day or week of work. As noted, medical treatment is Remedy’s primary application. The strain’s concentration of CBD is great for soothing condition-specific pain, as well as less serious afflictions like sore muscles or general physical tension. Meanwhile, some anti-inflammatory properties can take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. While not psychoactive per se, Remedy can still work to relieve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, thanks to its deeply embodied, relaxing effects. Similarly, Remedy is good for patients who may be prone to the panic and paranoia that can come with some more cerebrally stimulating strains. Remedy is also an option for pain patients who can’t or don’t want to consume analgesics like prescription opioids.Seeds of Remedy are not available for sale online; those looking to grow the strain must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. In general, CBD strains are considered harder to cultivate and may not be the most user-friendly choice for a novice grower. Some best practices for fostering CBD-rich plants include protecting against overwatering and ensuring consistently warm soil in indoor environments.Remedy is a great example of what advanced cannabis breeding can offer to the field of medicine. Hopefully, the gradual spread of cannabis legalization will create further opportunities for similarly therapeutic high-CBD strains.\n"

        "description": "Shoreline is a sativa-dominant hybrid with roots in an area not particularly known for prolific cannabis breeding: Houston, Texas. This strain was supposedly unveiled and popularized at a 1980s Grateful Dead concert at California’s Shoreline Amphitheatre, hence its name. Said to be a cross between pungent staple Skunk #1 and Northern Lights phenotype Oasis, Shoreline offers a soaring cerebral high that can open up adventurous and imaginative pathways for the intrepid smoke. This bud’s THC content has been measured at between 17% and 23%.Shoreline’s buds catch the eye right away with relatively large and solid flowers. These buds adhere in the dense structure commonly associated with sativas, but have the tapered, spindly shape more often seen in sativa-dominant varieties. The leaves are a pale shade of bluish green. More often than not, phenotypes of Shoreline also have patches of vivid purple in their leaves -- these surprising hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a blanket of translucent white trichomes coats these already-colorful flowers, giving them an icy appearance and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Shoreline has an unmistakably dank, “old school” scent. Skunky, acrid notes jump off of these impressive flowers and mingle with an underlying sweetness. Grinding up the buds reveals some notes of peppery spice. When burnt in a joint or a pipe, Shoreline gives off a harsh smoke that may tickle the palate and induce coughing for some. This smoke tastes skunky and earthy on the exhale, and its odor can carry for quite a distance. As such, some precautions may be required for smokers who’d like to maintain some discretion.Shoreline hits quickly, stunning the uninitiated with its strong head buzz. Smokers will feel a tingle around the temples and at the back of the neck, along with a sudden change in sensory perception. Certain external stimuli may take on new dimensions and users may be struck by such visual anomalies as distorted depth perception. Once consumers have adjusted to this trippy effect, a pattern of fast-paced cerebral thinking takes over. Some ideas or concepts may preoccupy the user, commanding more attention than they otherwise might. New avenues of association between seemingly unrelated concepts may also open themselves up to the thoughtful smoker. This alert mindset makes Shoreline a good aid in accomplishing work, whether it’s professional and task-based or more personal and open-ended. Alternatively, Shoreline is a great tool for unlocking a psychedelic experience, especially when enjoyed in the great outdoors -- for a trippy kick, enjoy it while kicking back at the beach, on an actual shoreline! This strain is not entirely without physical effects -- after some time, a mild body high creeps in and can take some edge off of the initially stimulating effects. Because of its high-flying energy, Shoreline is best consumed during the day; it makes a very good wake-and-bake treat.Shoreline’s energetic properties may also have some application for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained presence of mind can help those with attention deficit disorders to stay focused on single tasks. Its reality-warping effects may also temporarily numb the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Meanwhile, its anti-inflammatory properties can soothe minor physical irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can plunge users into deep and potentially paranoid modes of thinking, Shoreline is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Genuine seeds of Shoreline can be hard to come by, even from digital retailers. Clippings of mature, healthy plants that can be grown as clones are a better bet, especially if you live close to Houston. Once obtained, Shoreline can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Growers looking to bring out this bud’s full purple bag appeal should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees below average. Like many potent sativas, Shoreline requires a long flowering time -- in this case, about 12 weeks. The strain rewards patient growers with a high yield of flowers.This sky-high strain is not to be missed, especially for pure sativa lovers. Shoreline is also a prized strain for cannabis nerds and heirloom-chasers to cross off of their bucket lists.\n"

Created by prolific breeders Stoney Girl Gardens, who have also given us Pitbull, Sugar Plum is a cross between Hawaiian Haze Plum and Berkeley Blues. In addition to searing cerebral effects, this strain has a universally appealing flavor profile with distinctly tropical notes. These qualities earned Sugar Plum the title of First Place in the 2004 Oregon Medical Cannabis Awards. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of this strain to have between 9% and 26% THC.Sugar Plum is marked by medium to large-sized flowers that cling together in long, spindly formations. The buds make their sativa roots clear with a loose, piecey structure. The leaves have a fluffy appearance and can easily be torn away from their central stems. These leaves are a mossy green and are twisted through with orange and rust-colored pistils. Finally, a dense coat of icy white trichomes gives these flowers a wet, dewy appearance and makes them very difficult to break up without the aid of a quality grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Sugar Plum indeed boast the fruity aroma of fresh plums. On closer inspection, some sour notes of citrus are also present. If these buds are ground up, they yield hints of herbs and spice, similar to staple grandparent strain Haze. When combusted, Sugar Plum gives off a somewhat harsh smokes that’s liable to tickle the throat and trigger coughing fits. This thick smoke tastes fruity with some ammonia undertones on the exhale.The buzzy, active high from Sugar Plum hits almost instantly. Before they’ve finished coughing, smokers may notice an uptick in fast-paced cerebral thinking. Certain thoughts may command the bulk of the user’s attention and may flow into other ideas in freely associative ways. For many, this can engender a trippy mindset that’s ideal for spacing out to some atmospheric music. Sugar Plum can also bring about a very social mood, sparking conversation and camaraderie when it’s shared with like-minded friends. For users in a more productive mood, Sugar Plum can provide the energy needed to power through mundane tasks like cleaning the house or running errands. After some time, this bud’s fast-paced high wears off and is supplanted by a thorough feeling of body melt. Limbs and eyelids may begin to feel heavy and smokers may feel inspired to seek out the closest comfortable surroundings. If dosage is increased, couchlock can become a possibility. That said, some trippy, disordered thinking may remain and may have users seeing sugar-plum fairies. Because of its decrescendo from buzzy energy into sedate calm, Sugar Plum is best enjoyed from the late afternoon through the early evening.Sugar Plum may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its upbeat properties can have a positive effect for sufferers of mild to moderate stress and depression. The strain’s lucid feeling of focus may also be helpful for patients with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically speaking, the subtle body high on Sugar Plum’s backend can soothe aches and pains, from the chronic and serious to minor irritations like headaches. Patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume this strain with caution, as its sativa intensity can prove overwhelming for some.Although Stoney Girl has cultivated seeds of Sugar Plum, these only seem to be available at their brick and mortar location in Oregon and are not listed for sale online. As such, most prospective home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Sugar Plum is said to be an easy, user-friendly grow for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although those growing indoors should tame the height of these characteristically tall plants by regular trimming early in the vegetative stage. Despite its almost pure sativa genetics, this bud is a very fast crop, flowering within only 5 to 6 weeks when grown indoors.Sugar Plum is a powerful, mystical sativa that’s at home in a variety of settings and moods. Use it as a way to enjoy some introspective solo time or as a way to enhance a party.\n"

        "description": "Sunshine is a sativa-dominant hybrid whose name does an accurate job of describing its uplifting, optimistic effects. This strain was derived by Canadian breeders Peace Naturals Project, who also produce various THC concentrates like oils and creams. Although Sunshine’s genetic background remains a proprietary secret, there’s no denying the strain’s mental power, which allows for both creativity and clear-eyed focus. Sunshine’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 27%.Sunshine’s flowers can be visually underwhelming -- these buds tend to be small and pebbly, clinging together in dense, popcorn-like formations. The leaves are a pale green and are threaded through with orange and rust-colored hairs (which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of these flowers, giving them a slightly white sheen and accounting for their high psychoactivity.What Sunshine lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in aroma. When properly cured, the buds smell fruity and almost cloyingly sweet. On closer inspection, there are also some tropical citrus notes of pineapple. When this bud is broken up or ground, it releases an astringent chemical scent, perhaps hinting at some Chemdawg in Sunshine’s lineage. When combusted, the flowers burn with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes sweet and orangey on the exhale.Sunshine’s high takes hold quickly, with initial effects manifesting as a pressure around the eyes and forehead. This throbbing soon melts into an uplifted mindset, in which any prior cares or anxieties fade into the background. Smokers may also find themselves launched into an elevated pattern of cerebral thinking, with thoughts jumping from one to the next. For some, this kind of mindrace may be overwhelming and disorienting. In the right set and setting though, Sunshine can provide the ideal backdrop for working on problem-solving scenarios, as well as more creative endeavors. This strain may provide the requisite energy for getting out and about to accomplish mundane tasks like cleaning or grocery shopping. For some, it can also be an effective exercise aid. Unlike some other potent sativas, Sunshine is remarkable for its lack of an uncomfortable “comedown” -- instead, consumers can peacefully taper off into a mildly relaxing physical state. This strain is as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared to facilitate conversation among like-minded friends. True to its name, Sunshine is best enjoyed during the daytime. It makes a great wake-and-bake strain, as well as a satisfying afternoon treat.Sunshine can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its generally uplifting vibes can temporarily lessen or eliminate the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Its single-minded focus can also help those with attention deficit disorders to keep their attention on a single task. Physiologically speaking, Sunshine’s relaxation may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to condition like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Because its deeply cerebral mindset can easily veer into paranoia, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Peace Naturals Project has not made seeds of Sunshine available for sale online. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of the strain from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Sunshine can be grown indoors or outdoors, although outdoor success depends on a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain’s sativa roots suggest exceptionally tall plants that may require regular pruning in order to contain their heights within limited indoor spaces. These sativa genetics also imply a long flowering time of anywhere between 9 to 11 weeks.With long-lasting effects and a crowd-pleasing flavor to boot, Sunshine is a must-try for sativa lovers. If you plan to bring it out for a toke in social situations, bring enough to share, as this bud’s tropical aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

The sativa-leaning hybrid was created by Colorado Seed, Inc., who have given us strains like Dr. Feelgood as well as Gupta Kush itself. With powerhouse hybrid Blue Dream in its background, Sweet Dream was born to impress. It emanates fruity and earthy fumes and offers smokers a smooth, psychedelic high. This strain’s potency has been measured at between 13% and 23%.Sweet Dream’s flowers tend to be small to medium in size. They adhere in a bullet-like shape, tapering from a broad base to a smaller, almost rounded tip. The tightly-packed leaves cling together in a dense, indica-typical bud structure. These leaves are a dark shade of olive green and are shot through with brown and orange pistils. A sprinkling of translucent white trichomes covers the flowers, lending them an icy sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Sweet Dream bursts with a fruity blueberry aroma that makes parent strain Blue Dream so popular. On closer inspection, the buds also have an underlying earthiness and musk. Meanwhile, grinding open Sweet Dream’s dense nuggets yields some woodsy notes of pine. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, this strain burns with a smooth and exceptionally flavorful smoke that tastes earthy and citrusy on the exhale.Sweet Dream offers a creeper of a high and may take as long as 10 to 15 minutes after users have ingested its tasty smoke to reveal its effects. Once under its spell, smokers may notice some odd changes in their sensory perception, as well as trippy sensations like time dilation and even depersonalization. As they’re able to acclimate to this altered state, smokers may pick up on a heightened sense of analysis, characterized by fast-paced, associative thinking and a focus on topics that may otherwise seem uninteresting. This cerebral frame of thinking can be a good way to spark conversation in social situations. It can also help consumers to accomplish a mountain of work, whether it’s task-based or more creative and open-ended.As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, a pervasive feeling of calm seeps in, sending waves of relaxation down the spine that spread through the core and limbs. At this point, couchlock may take over, providing the perfect excuse for kicking back after a long day for a binge-watching session. Any earlier tendency toward deep analytical thinking may be softened by this point, replaced by a hazy sort of daydreaming. Because of its gradual decrease in energy, Sweet Dream is recommended for late afternoon or early evening use. If toked just before bed, it’s liable to keep smokers thoughtful and animated.Sweet Dream’s balanced effects can also have application for medical cannabis patients. It can stoke hunger, helping people who may have lost their hunger to disease or to harsh treatments like chemotherapy. The strain’s generally positive, uplifting effects can also temporarily take the edge off of the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. This hybrid’s physical sedation can also have medical value, serving to dull chronic, nerve-based pain as well as everyday annoyances like nausea and headaches. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume this strain with caution, as its early effects are deeply cerebral and could lead to paranoia.Colorado Seed has not made seeds of Sweet Dream available for sale online. As such, prospective growers need to obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants of the strain from a reliable source in order to grow genetically identical clones. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Sweet Dream’s plant grow short and bushy; growers should be sure to trim away any broad fan leaves that could prevent light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes.Sweet Dream is a great option for some calm, introspective solo time as well as for more boisterous social settings. With a versatile balance of effects, it’s poised to impress indica and sativa lovers alike.\n"

        "description": "Named in the tradition of its parent strain Girl Scout Cookies, Do Si Do is a soothing indica hybrid. This bud combines aromatic Girl Scout Cookies and body-melting indica Face Off OG. The product is a pungent and well-balanced strain whose effects seem to last longer than average. Do Si Do can be potent for even experienced cannabis users, with THC levels clocking in at between 19% and a whopping 30%.Buds of Do Si Do are typically small in size and adhere in small, popcorn-like clusters. Like many predominantly indica varieties, the flowers have a dense structure, with the small leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. What these flowers lack in size, they make up for in color. The leaves themselves are a deep shade of forest green and hold an abundance of bright orange pistils. Sometimes, the leaves also boast hints of purple, which come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics are activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a thick, even coat of icy white trichomes covers these buds and accounts for their psychoactivity.Unlike Girl Scout Cookies, Do Si Do smells nothing like its namesake -- the flowers explode with an overly sweet, almost fermented odor. Also present are some dank, earthy notes. Meanwhile, grinding up these tight buds gives off some skunkiness, providing evidence of the OG Kush in this bud’s lineage. These strong-smelling flowers can give off a harsh, acrid smoke when combusted. This smoke is said to taste simultaneously fruity and skunky on the exhale. Discreet consumers should keep in mind that Do Si Do pungency can carry for quite a distance.Do Si Do hits the consumer quickly with both barrels of psychoactivity -- at almost the same time as they detect a tingle in the upper face, smokers may notice an uptick in cerebral functioning. Thoughts may flow in free association and can aid concentration on task-based, analytical kinds of work. This bud may also open up creative avenues and set the stage for brainstorming. A calming body high keeps this cerebral mindset from becoming too buzzy. Rather than agitation, smokers typically begin to feel progressive relaxation that spread down through the cre and limbs. This sensation can be a great way to kick back and enjoy some introspective solo time with a drink or some atmospheric music. Alternatively, Do Si Do’s vibe can be uniquely social, sparking conversation and some laughs when shared with like-minded friends. The strain’s combination of mental and physical stimulation makes it a good way to enhance activities that involve full-body coordination, like exercising, dancing, and in the right set and setting, sex. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes more of a possibility. Because it tends to taper down into an immobilized state of calm, Do Si Do is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening.Do Si Do may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its physical effects can be an analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Furthermore, the strain’s anti-inflammatory properties may numb everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Psychologically speaking, this bud’s calming vibes can temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Because it can inspire some intense, recursive thinking in its early stages, Do Si Do is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic and paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately, seeds of Do Si Do are available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers looking to bring out the colorful purple potential of these flowers should temporarily expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures just before flowering begins. The strain is said to produce an average yield at harvest time. Finally, just as it is a pungent smoke, Do Si Do can be a very pungent grow; indoor growers looking to keep their operations under wraps should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters or exhaust fans.Supremely balanced, Do Si Do’s high is sure to appeal to both indica and sativa lovers. It’s a reliable all-purpose strain for both the casual and frequent smoker.\n"

        "description": "The term “OG” has generated some confusion in cannabis genetics -- while many assume that the letters are an abbreviation for “original gangster,” they actually signify that a strain is “ocean grown,” in forgiving Pacific climates. True OG is a strain that exemplifies the best of this California-cultivated lineage. Developed by Elemental Seeds, the strain is bred from OG Kush stock and offers versatile and well-balanced effects. True OG’s potency has won it the title of 2nd Best Indica in the 2010 High Times Medical Cannabis Cup. Its THC levels have been measured at between 15% and 24%.Flowers of True OG can be identified by their small, squat stature. The buds are relatively small and adhere in a tapered, pinecone-like shape, with distinctly pointed tips. The leaves curl tightly inward in the dense bud structure often associated with indicas. These leaves are a pale sea green and are beset with curly orange and brown pistils. Finally, a coat of cloudy white trichomes dots the inner and outer surfaces of the leaves, giving True OG’s flowers a white sheen when viewed from a distance.When properly cured, flowers of True OG erupt with a rich odor of fresh pine mixed with skunk. On closer inspection, there is also an underlying dank, earthy quality. Meanwhile, grinding up these buds yields some incense-like notes, likely carried over from grandparent strain Afghani. When combusted, True OG burns with a somewhat sour, acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and sinuses and induce coughing. Nevertheless, this harsh smoke has a pleasant pine taste, accented a hint of citrus on the exhale.True OG’s high tends to creep up slowly, sometimes taking as long as 10 minutes to show itself. Initially, smokers may detect a growing pressure around the forehead and temples. As they acclimate to this sensation, users are enveloped in a warm wash of euphoria, as any prior stresses or cares melt into the background. Some trippy effects may also be present, such as changes in depth perception or a feeling of time passing more slowly. Psychedelically-minded users can intensify these effects with atmospheric music or a moody movie. For those in a more productive mood, True OG provides also considerable stimulation for the mind, sparking the free association of thoughts and ideas. This mindset makes the strain a great accompaniment for complicated, task-based work. True OG can also be a fun accompaniment to mundane activities like cleaning the house or running errands. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, True OG is more and more likely to weigh down the limbs and eyelids in equal measure. At this point, couchlock is a real possibility -- and any previous efforts at lucid productivity tend to dissolve. In all, True OG is great for cozying up and kicking back alone at the end of a long, stressful day. Because of its gradually decreasing energy, this strain is recommended for use in the late afternoon or early evening.True OG can also have some true utility for medical cannabis patients. Its mood-altering properties can temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also soothe physical pain, whether that pain is temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. In high enough doses, True OG can lull even insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should exercise caution when consuming this bud, as its initial mental stimulation has the possibility of leading to paranoia.As True OG is Elemental’s flagship strain, they have made seeds of this bud widely available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to be short and bushy and can be easily accommodated indoors. True OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks and offers growers a moderate yield at maturity.Indica and sativa lovers alike should toke on this popular strain to understand just why it’s so renowned. True OG’s thick, long-lasting high and powerful aroma also make it a winner for lovers of old-school cannabis genetics.\n"

        "description": "Venom OG is an indica-leaning strain with a high that’s as potent -- but not nearly as menacing -- as its name. Created by Rare Dankness, the prolific breeders who have also developed Ghost Train Haze, Venom OG is a cross between their proprietary Rare Dankness #1 and Poison OG. The strain offers mostly relaxing sedative effects that are therapeutic enough to soothe pain and anxiety yet stimulating enough to enjoy recreationally. Venom OG’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 11% and a whopping 27%.This strain’s buds range in size from small to medium and cling together in elongated, almost cylindrical shapes. They have the unmistakable structure of other indica-dominant varieties, with leaves curled tightly inward, forming a solid and compact flower. The leaves themselves are a bright spring green and are twisted through with vibrant orange hairs (which are actually pistils, botanical structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). A carpet of translucent white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these nuggets, making them very difficult to break up by hand.Venom OG’s compact flowers emit an aroma with dominant notes of skunk and damp earth. Hanging out under this musk is a hint of fresh pine. Grinding up or breaking apart the buds, meanwhile, yields some diesel fumes, possibly due to the influence of grandparent strain Chemdawg. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Venom OG burns with a harsh smoke that may induce coughing fits for some. On the exhale, this smoke tastes both piney and skunky.The active ingredient in this venom is slow to act, with as much as 15 minutes’ lag time between smoking and feeling its effects. Eventually, smokers detect a throbbing around the forehead and eyes, as well as an increased heaviness in the limbs. Some may find themselves able to breathe more deeply and easily as any muscular tension evaporates. Slowly but surely, a full body high sets in, sending waves of relaxation rolling down the spine and outward through the core and limbs. The pervasive worries of the day tend to fade into the background as Venom OG makes the consumer aware of nothing but their immediate surroundings and sensory inputs. Beyond pure relaxation, Venom OG offers some mental distortion in the form of changes to sensory perception. This may entail an intensification of certain sights and sounds or an artificial flattening of depth and perspective. In the right set and setting and with the right group of people, this bud can be a very social asset, inspiring conversation and good vibes. Smokers shouldn’t plan on being productive or accomplishing large amounts of work under Venom OG’s influence, as it’s more likely to leave them cloudy and dazed than cerebrally focused. After a while, couchlock becomes likely, as does sleep. As such, Venom OG is best enjoyed at night -- or at least during a particularly lazy day.Venom OG also has several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its soothing, even-tempered effects can temporarily relieve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Physiologically speaking, the strain may also dull deep-seated aches and pains, as well as minor irritations like headaches and nausea. As noted, in high enough doses, Venom OG can counteract insomnia, lulling relaxed consumers into a deep and thorough sleep. Because it’s unlikely to trigger the kind of deep, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, Venom OG is a solid option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Rare Dankness sells seeds of Venom OG through several digital vendors. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to grow short and bushy, and growers may need to “top” them, by trimming away any broad fan leaves that may block light and air from nurturing any low-growing flowering nodes. Venom OG flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.You won’t need to bother reaching for an antidote when under the influence of Venom OG. Whether you’re using it to quell stress or to kick back with friends, enjoy the full range of this bud’s long-lasting effects.\n"

        "description": "Like Green Crack (and not to be confused with LSD), Acid is a strain named for a somewhat more psychoactive substance. Nevertheless, Acid has a potency of its own, offering balanced effects along with a very complex aroma. Created by Paradise Seeds, the breeders of Delahaze and Sensi Star, Acid is derived from the genetics of regional favorite New York Sour Diesel. Its appeal has earned it the title of 3rd Best Indoor-Grown Flower in Spain’s 2016 Copa THC Valencia. Acid’s THC levels have been measured at between 16% and 23%.Acid impresses with medium to large-sized flowers that hold a pronounced spade-like shape, almost like mini Christmas trees, tapering down from a wide circular base to a pointed tip. With a tight, dense structure, it’s clear that these buds couldn’t be anything but indica-dominant. The leaves, curled tightly inward toward their central stems, are a dark mossy green and are twisted through with curly brown pistils. Finally, shiny white trichomes cover the inner and outer surfaces of Acid’s flowers, giving the strain its psychoactive punch and making the buds very hard to break up without the aid of a grinder.When properly cured, Acid indeed has a slightly acidic aroma, marked by a sharp tang of citrus. There are also strong, musky base notes, redolent of damp soil and incense. Meanwhile, breaking apart or grinding up these dense nugs releases the astringent fumes of gasoline that makes parent strain New York Sour Diesel so pungent and popular. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Acid burns with a smooth and easily ingested smoke. This rich smoke leaves behind the taste of lemon and diesel on the exhale.Acid’s high reveals itself slowly at first, warping the smoker’s perception of their external stimuli. Certain sounds may be amplified, as if generated inside an echo chamber. Similarly, vivid colors and brights lights may take on a new intensity. Once these sensory effects become full-blown, more immersive psychedelic phenomena set in, like distortions in depth perception and a strong feeling of time dilation. Within some time, smokers may feel a concerted pressure around the temples and lymph glands, as well as a slight increase in salivation. These tingles progress into waves of relaxation that roll down the spine and radiate out through the core and limbs. While users may not be totally immobilized by these soothing effects, they may feel inspired to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings.Acid’s high is also characterized by a cerebral mindset in which the smoker’ may attach to random thoughts or concepts, finding them more interesting than they otherwise might be. Such freely-associative thinking can be a good way to find creative solutions to entrenched problems or to tackle certain work tasks. As time passes -- or as dosage is increased -- Acid’s mental effects become more dreamy than lucid, rendering any prior productivity null and void. Because of its gradual decrease in energy, this strain should be enjoyed during the late afternoon or evening.Acid’s versatile effects can also have may applications for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s early tendency to induce focus and concentration can be instrumental in helping those with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. Its uplifting, positive vibes may also temporarily soothe the difficult symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. On the physical side, Acid can take care of deep, nerve-based aches and pains, as well as minor everyday irritations like headaches. Because this strain can bring about fairly intense patterns of recursive thinking, patients who are prone to paranoia or panic should consume Acid with caution.Fortunately, Paradise Seeds has made seeds of Acid available to home growers. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This can be a particularly resilient and user-friendly grow for novices to cannabis cultivation. Acid flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors; it offers a low to modest yield of flowers at maturity.While it may not make you smell colors or see the walls melt, Acid packs enough punch to scramble smokers’ minds with both stimulation and sedation.\n"

        "description": "The name would have you believe this would be one to stay away from, but rest assured that you’d be missing out if you passed up the chance to try Green Poison. The breeders at Sweet Seed broke the mold with their audaciously flavorful and unique bud that comes in at a nice 70/30 indica-dominant level. These pepper shaped, minty green nugs give off an intensely inviting aroma of flowers and fruit, punctuated by hints of earthiness and skunk. From the first hit you can feel the high THC levels, ranging from 15% to 20%, working their way around for a smooth and tasty high that leaves a perfect blend of sweet and spicy on the tongue. Thick sticky resin and amber trichomes round out the beauty of this bud. Don’t be disappointed if after a couple of hits you aren’t quite there yet as this bud takes a little bit to really get going. She’s a sneaky one, biding her time before completely washing over you. With a tingly head and a completely relaxed body, you’ll feel all your tension flood out of you as you reach for another drag. Whether you are a morning or an evening smoker, Green Poison is a great companion as it leaves users feeling happy and uplifted. Keep in mind, this is a full body experience that will leave you spacey and totally stoned. Green Poison is beneficial for those suffering from mild to moderate chronic pain as it completely relaxes your body from head to toe. For those who are easily susceptible to migraines or severe headaches, this strain will leave you feeling long lasting relief, albeit slow going at first. If you are a new user, be aware that Green Poison gives a heavily stoned feeling and can cause major flightiness that could be problematic if you’re not used to that sensation. Enjoy the relief from stress, depression, and other mood disorders as this is an uplifting high. Beware, as this plant is extremely susceptible to fungus and is a hard starter. Intermediate to advanced growers are highly recommended when it comes to Green Poison. This beauty will grow indoors with a moderately high yield at about 7 to 9 weeks, depending on conditions, or a late September harvest if grown outdoors. This bud sounds perfect, right? It is. Not only is it a fun little high complete with a body buzz and head tingles, it’s also incredibly helpful for medicinal purposes. Green Poison is best for a long-lasting, slow-moving high that will stay with you throughout the day.\n"

        "description": "Afghan Cow is a sativa-leaning strain that may be as potent as it is hard to find. Created by London-based Dr. Krippling Seeds, this bud is crossed from legendary Kali Mist, AK-47 phenotype Kaya 47, and landrace-descended Ash. This strain hits lucky smokers with strong cerebral effects, making it a great accompaniment for a wide range of activities. With a double dose of Afghani in Ash’s background, Afghan Cow also offers a grounding effect with some smooth physical relaxation. This strain’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 18% and 22%.Afghan Cow is marked by medium to large-sized flowers that adhere in an almost conical shape. Though this is a sativa strain, its pointy buds betray its indica genetics, with a dense, tightly-bound structure. The leaves, curling tightly inward toward their central stems, are a dark olive green and are covered in curly brown and orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. A sprinkling of cloudy white trichomes covers the nooks and crannies of the curly leaves, giving Afghan Cow a dewy appearance when viewed from afar.Luckily, those looking to sample Afghan Cow’s buzzy effects don’t have to have to put up with any kind of bovine odor. To the contrary, when they’re properly cured, a sugary-sweet, similar to vanilla icing, wafts up from the flowers. On closer inspection, there’s a slightly sour undercurrent as well. Grinding up Afghan Cow’s dense buds give off notes of spice and hash, passed on from grandparent strain Afghani. When burnt, this strain gives off a smoke that’s as smooth as the flowers’ pleasant aroma. This smoke tastes sweet and just slightly herbal on the exhale.Like many other sativas, Afghan Cow hits the smoker quickly. Initial effects can be observed as a tingle around the lower forehead and temples (the same constricting sensation for which popular strain Headband is named). This odd feeling gives way to a change in thinking in which ideas and concepts flow through the smoker’s mind in rapid succession, prompting new connections or insights or simply illuminating the everyday. Afghan Cow’s cerebral headspace is an obvious supplement to social situations, where it can prompt talkativeness and camaraderie among like-minded friends. In the right set and setting, this strain is also a great way to accomplish a long to-do list, whether it’s detail and work-related or more mundane, like cleaning. For the more active and athletically-inclined, Afghan Cow’s buzzy energy can be a good way to motivate and enhance exercise -- although consumers should always avoid potentially dangerous equipment like freeweights when under the influence. This strain’s physical effects, if they can be discerned at all, manifest as a warmth and tingle, and are unlikely to slow users down. Afghan Cow is recommended for daytime use, as an afternoon energy boost or as a treat to pair with morning coffee. If consumed before bedtime, it’s likely to keep smokers awake and wired.Afghan Cow’s upbeat effects can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its long-lasting propensity for concentration can help those with attention deficit disorder to focus on a single task. The bud may also be a good way to temporarily alleviate mild cases of stress and depression. To a lesser degree, physical effects can lessen pain, whether it’s serious and disease-related or common, like a headache. Afghan Cow is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic, as its deeply cerebral “mindrace” can easily veer into paranoid territory.Dr. Krippling has made seeds of Afghan Cow available online. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should regularly trim any oversized fan leaves that can prevent light and air from nourishing any flowering nodes growing on lower branches. Afghan Cow flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. Under the right conditions, it can offer an incredibly high yield of up to 79 grams (or 2.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Although somewhat difficult to find, Afghan Cow is worth adding to your stable. Its strong landrace roots make it a must-try for sativa lovers.\n"

        "description": "Alaska is a sativa-dominant hybrid that offers long-lasting, fast-paced effects. It is the brainchild of Tikun Olam, a breeding operation based in cannabis hot spot Israel. Unfortunately, Tikun Olam has kept Alaska’s genetic background a proprietary secret -- but there’s no mystery to this bud’s power to boost energy and improve mood. There must be something in the water in Israel -- THC was first discovered there in 1964, and the team at Tikun Olam have since refined its cultivation, achieving eye-popping levels of up to 30% THC with Alaska.Alaska is marked by medium to large flowers that have an elongated shape. Rather than the “nuggets” typically associated with more indica-dominant varieties, these flowers are elongated in almost cylindrical shapes, like mini cypress trees. The soft leaves spiral loosely outward from their central stems and have a piecey, fluffy appearance. These leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Finally, amber trichomes give Alaska’s buds a slight yellow sheen and make them particularly resinous to the touch.Holding a cured flower of Alaska to the nose yields mostly peppery, almost savory notes. On closer inspection, there is also an underlying dankness, similar to damp earth. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart Alaska’s spindly flowers gives off some skunky pungency. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Alaska burns with an acrid smoke that can easily tickle the palate and the sinuses. This smoke tastes spicy with some hints of pine and cedar on the exhale.Alaska hits the smoker quickly, exerting a gentle throbbing around the eyes and temples, along with a tingle in the salivary glands. This strain also throws standard sensory perceptions out of whack, introducing trippy elements like visual distortions and an amplification of sights and sounds. Alaska’s loud, imminent energy banishes troubles or preoccupations, making smokers focus on their immediate surroundings. In addition to these sensations, Alaska’s high is marked by an uptick in recursive, cerebral thinking. Some smokers may find themselves turning the same ideas over and over in their minds; others can feel their thoughts flow rapidly in free association. While this mindrace can be overwhelming for some, in the right set and setting, Alaska can provide euphoria. Its mental buzz can make users giddy and talkative, especially when surrounded by -- or sharing with -- a group of like-minded friends. For those feeling more productive, this strain’s cerebral properties can be good for plowing through complex, work-related tasks. It’s also helpful in lowering inhibitions and opening up new pathways of creativity. Its enhancement of the natural world makes this strain an especially great way to enjoy the great outdoors. Though this high is mostly sativa-dominant, some subtle physical relaxation can eventually creep in, encompassing anything from heavy limbs to a tendency to zone out. Because it is so buzzy and active, Alaska is best consumed during the day; if enjoyed before bed, it’s liable to keep consumers wired and awake.Alaska’s alert, sharp-eyed effects can have many benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. The strain can temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Its initial feelings of focus may also enhance concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. Alaska’s physical properties can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Because its mindrace can be dizzying and disoriented, possibly leading to paranoia for some, Alaska should be avoided by patients who are especially prone to panic and anxiety or who have a low tolerance for THC.Tikun Olam has not made seeds of Alaska available for sale online. Instead, prospective growers must obtain clippings of mature plants from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” While there is little information available on specific best practices for cultivating Alaska, we know that, like many hybrids, in can be grown indoors or outdoors in hot and humid climates. Its sativa-leaning genetics also suggest that the strain can grow quite tall, requiring indoor growers to prune back their crops early in the growing process. Because it is a sativa, Alaska is also likely to have a longer flowering time of about 10 weeks.Alaska is a high-powered sativa that’s as enjoyable in social situations as it is for solo use. In the right circumstances, it can make you feel like you like you’re cruising peacefully through the Alaskan wilderness.\n"

        "description": "Aloha is an energetic and tasty strain with roots in none other than the 50th state, Hawaii. Although its genetics are undocumented, Aloha may be derived from hardy Hawaiian sativa landrace strains. This popular bud is known for inducing an alert and thoughtful mindset, along with pervasive energy -- its fruity, seemingly tropical flavor is just icing on the cake. Aloha’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 18%.Aloha sets itself apart with medium-sized flowers that adhere in almost globular formation. Though tightly-packed at the core, these flowers have loose, fluffy leaves that twist out along the fringes. The leaves themselves are a bright, yellowish green. Aloha’s bud are also notable for their unique and eye-catching red pistils that stand out in vivid contrast against the leaves. Finally, a carpet of cloudy white trichomes covers these already-colorful flowers, making them very sticky to the touch.When properly cured, Aloha gives off strong citrus notes that are more sweet than tangy or sour. On closer inspection, this fruity aroma has a tropical edge, almost like grapefruit or pineapple. Grinding up or picking apart Aloha’s ragged-looking flowers unlocks their herbal scent, which is somewhat reminiscent of staple strain Haze. Aloha burns with a very smooth and easily palatable smoke when it is combusted in a pipe or a joint. This smoke tastes mouth-puckeringly sweet and citrusy on the exhale.Unusually, given its pure sativa makeup, Aloha takes effect quickly. Shortly after savoring its candy-like smoke, users may feel a throbbing behind the eyes or around the temples. This odd physical sensation soon matched with psychological tricks -- some sights or sounds may be greatly intensified and take on new dimensions, while many smokers report a powerful feeling of time dilation. Once acclimated to the texture of this high, consumers can enjoy the buzzy head high that Aloha provides. Whether they’re inspired by random association or simply rise out of the ether, thoughts and ideas may flow through the user’s mind. This cerebral mindset can also be a good way to spark conversation and camaraderie with friends and strangers alike. Similarly, Aloha’s mental energy can be useful in clearing the smoker’s outbox and plowing through a mountain of detailed, task-based work. In some circumstances, the strain’s thought-provoking nature may unlock inspiration for brainstorms or creative projects. For those feeling somewhat less motivated, this bud can be fun for simply enhancing mundane activities like doing the dishes or the laundry. With not indica influences, Aloha is unlikely to bring about any pronounced physical effects -- although its potency may be enough to keep susceptible users humming along with sheer energy. A quintessential wake-and-bake strain, Aloha is best-suited to daytime use. Enjoyed at night, it’s very likely to keep smokers awake and wired.Aloha’s fast-paced effects can have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its lucid and acute focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on a single task. The strain’s uplifting vibes can also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate stress and depression. Furthermore, the same ocular pressure that comes with this high’s onset can relieve some symptoms of glaucoma. Because it can trigger intense, recursive patterns of thinking, Aloha is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No commercial breeders seem to have cultivated Aloha As such, seeds are not available for sale online. Prospective home growers should obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Although there is little public information available on best practices for growing this specific strain, we know that its landrace lineage may make for resilient plants that can stand up to adverse growing conditions. We also know that Aloha’s plants can grow particularly tall; indoor growers should trim back their crops early in the growing process in order to train them to fit in limited indoor spaces. Finally, Aloha is likely to have a long flowering time of at least 9 and as many as 12 weeks.Aloha is a great strain for both relaxing solo time and party environments. If you bring this bud out in public, bring enough to share, as its pleasant aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Armageddon is a sativa-dominant hybrid that packs a serious punch. As its name implies, this strain is very potent and can stand up to the expectations of cannabis newbies and veterans alike. Armageddon’s creators, Netherlands-based Homegrown Fantaseeds, have kept its genetic background information proprietary. Nevertheless, Armageddon scores points for a strong, long-lasting head high that’s balanced out by subtle physical effects. This strain’s THC levels have been measured at between 15% and 20%.Flowers of Armageddon stand out with their distinctively elongated, spindly shape. Small to medium in size, these buds have a characteristically sativa structure, with ragged-looking leaves clinging loosely to their central stems. The leaves themselves express mossy green hues and are twisted through with curly brown hairs -- which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from flowering male plants. Finally, cloudy white trichomes dust the inner and outer surfaces of Armageddon’s flowers, accounting for their psychoactivity and giving them a very resinous texture. When its flowers are properly cured, Armageddon has a complex aroma that may give some hints as to its genetics. The buds give off strong, gasoline-tinged fumes, suggesting some connection to sativa staple Sour Diesel. On closer inspection, there are also some fruity, lemony notes. Meanwhile, grinding up these tight nugs yields a skunky-sweet odor. When burnt, Armageddon gives off a harsh smoke that can make some consumers tear up. This acrid smoke has flavors on diesel and lemon on the exhale, giving an overall impression that’s somewhat like artificially-scented home cleaning products.While Armageddon’s diesel aroma may certainly smell like the end of the world, its high is anything but apocalyptic. Unusually for a sativa, this high can creep up on the consumer. Several minutes after ingesting (or coughing on) Armageddon’s smoke, users may feel a gradually mounting pressure around the eyes and temples. At the same time, smokers’ thoughts kick into high year, jumping from one to the next in rapid free association. Some altered sensory experiences, such as an intensified perception of sights and sounds, are also commonly reported. This active, stimulated mindset can be a good way to tackle a long list of work related-tasks, whether they’re complicated and analytical or more open-ended and creative. Alternative, the strain can be a fun way to jazz up mundane activities like cleaning the house or grocery shopping. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Armageddon comes noticeably more sedative, with deep physical relaxation grounding out the bud’s prior excitement. While users may not necessarily become couchlocked, they’re likely to feel some heaviness in their limbs and an increased capacity for deep, restorative breathing. This eventual combination of physical and mental stimulation is well-suited to activities that involve coordination of both body and mind, like exercising or playing video games.Armageddon can also have several therapeutic effects for medical cannabis patients as well. Its lucid, clear-eyed focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. Its mood-elevating effects can also temporarily relieve the symptoms of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, this bud’s subtle effects can also take care of deep-seated aches and pains, as well as mild everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because its cerebral onset can prove too intense for some, Armageddon is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Homegrown has made seeds of Armageddon available online; they can be shipped both inside and outside of the company’s home base in Europe. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. That said, Armageddon is said to be a forgiving crop for novice growers and may be resistant to adverse conditions like temperature variations. Plants flower within 8 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors. At maturity, these plants offers a high yield of flowers for patient growers. Finally, Armageddon can be a particularly pungent grow; those looking to keep their indoor grow rooms discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters.Armageddon is as enjoyable for mellow solo use as it is when shared with boisterous, like-minded friends. Its balance of effects make it a must-try for indica and sativa lovers alike.\n"

        "description": "Butter OG is a mysterious, indica-leaning strain with a superlatively sedative high. This potent strain’s breeders and lineage are unfortunately unknown -- but there’s no denying the power of Butter OG the lay even experienced smokers out flat with its palpable body high. Butter OG is also notable for the oddly creamy feeling to which its name refers. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Butter OG’s flowers are marked by their particularly small size. The tiny buds cling together in popcorn-like clusters and have the dense, solidly-packed structure usually associated with indicas. The rumpled leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with curly orange and brown hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures intended to catch pollen when flowering female plants are in proximity to fertilizing male plants. Finally, a thick coating of sticky white trichomes sits on top of these already-colorful flowers, giving them a silvery sheen and making them very difficult to break up without a grinder.Butter OG has a complex aroma that may provide some hints as to the bud’s background. At first, sweet and fruity notes predominate. On closer inspection, there are also hints of ammonia, suggesting the influence of popular sativa Chemdawg. On the other hand, grinding up the strain’s buds yields a dank and hashy odor, raising the specter of landrace Afghani. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Butter OG burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. As noted, this smoke has a creamy, vanilla tastes on the exhale, roughly approximating the taste of sweet cream butter.Butter OG offers a slow, creeping high -- it may take as many as 15 minutes after users have savored its smoke before they begin to feel a tingle and a mounting warmth at the temples and the back of the neck. This odd physical sensation is accompanied by some psychological ones. Smokers commonly experience some trippy sensory distortions, in which external stimuli take on odd new dimensions. Many users also report feelings of time dilation or a skewed depth perception. Once acclimated to this altered state, though, users begin to ease into Butter OG’s high as if climbing into a hot bath. Waves of relaxation roll down the spine and radiate out through the core and limbs. If they haven’t already assumed the position, Butter OG will inspire its consumers to kick back in the closest comfortable surroundings and indulge in a binge-watching session or to listen to some atmospheric music. Not a particularly focused or cerebral, this strain is best enjoyed as an accompaniment to daydreaming or relaxing with like-minded friends. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, users may find themselves melting into whatever surface they happen to be nestled on. Because of its very sleepy vibes, Butter OG is recommended for nighttime -- and even bedtime -- use.Butter OG’s sedative properties can have several uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its soothing energy can be a temporary antidote to the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also take care of physical pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or merely temporary, like a headache. Under the right conditions, this bud can even lull insomniacs into a deep and satisfying sleep. Because it is unlikely to force its consumers into a cerebral and paranoid headspace, Butter OG is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Since Butter OG seems not to have been grown on a large enough scale to facilitate commercial seed production, prospective growers must foster genetically identical “clones” from clippings of existing plants. Once obtained, Butter OG can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain’s indica properties suggest that its plants grow short and bushy and may requires growers to “top” them by trimming away any broad fan leaves that might prevent light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes.An ideal option for unwinding after a long day or week of work, Butter OG is as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared with friends.\n"

        "description": "Cali Gold is an indica-dominant hybrid that explodes with flavor and potency. Originally from the Golden State, this bud is a cross between two relatively rare strains: Jah OG Kush (which also has roots in California) and DS Gold. Cali Gold is well-known for its ability to relax the user’s body and mind without entirely incapacitating them. This soothing strain’s THC content has been measured at between 16% and 21%.Cali Gold’s flowers tend to be only small to medium in size, adhering in tight, almost spherical formations. The buds hold the dense structure one might expect of an indica variety, with its leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with orange and brown pistils. Finally, translucent amber trichomes cover these already-colorful buds, giving them the yellowish glow to which the strain’s name refers.When properly cured, Cali Gold has a predominantly earthy smell that’s accented by some grassy, vegetal notes. There are also light and pleasant floral scents lurking underneath, brightening up the overall impression. Meanwhile, grinding up Cali Gold’s nuggets gives off the scent of rich and woodsy pine. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, the strain gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes lemony with some hints of dank earth on the exhale.Cali Gold takes effect quickly, considering its indica roots. Shortly after inhaling its pleasant herbal smoke, smokers are apt to experience some unusual cognitive effects, beginning with a change in sensory perception. Sights and sounds may take on a new intensity and dimension, while some pseudo-hallucinogenic effects like time dilation or warped depth perception are also possible. Soon after, smokers may also detect some slight uptick in the pace and complexity of their patterns of thought. Ideas may jump around in free association or may turn themselves over and over in the consumer’s mind. This kind of cerebral shift can be a good way to enhance productivity, whether the user is attempting to finish work-based tasks or to power through boring, time-consuming errands.This strain’s physical effects take hold in almost equal measure, first relaxing the facial muscles and then pulverizing any lingering tension in the core and limbs. As time passes, these effects become more pronounced, weighing down eyelids and inspiring susceptible consumers to assume a horizontal position in the closest comfortable surroundings. Because of this propensity towards couchlock, Cali Gold is best enjoyed at night, when smokers can fully enjoy its descent into numbness and sedation.Cali Gold’s downbeat properties can also prove useful to medical cannabis patients as well. It can relieve aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The strain can also take the sting out of minor annoyances like headaches and indigestion. Psychologically speaking, Cali Gold’s calming nature can temporarily relieve the acute symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. At a high enough dosage, it’s also liable to lull insomniacs into a deep, fulfilling sleep. Because this bud is not known to induce a powerfully cerebral mindset with recursive patterns of thinking, it is a good option for patients who are prone to panic and paranoia, or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Cali Gold do not appear to have been cultivated for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical clones. Cali Gold can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors depends on a semi-humid climate similar to that of its native California, with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These crops tend to have an indica silhouette, growing short and bushy with wide lateral branches. Vigilant growers should be sure to regularly “top” their plants by cutting back any broad fan leaves that could block light and air from nurturing flowering nodes on lower branches. Cali Gold has a brief flowering time of about 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Cali Gold determines a new gold standard for soothing, well-balanced hybrids. If you bring this strain out in crowded social settings, be sure to bring enough to share, as its complex aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

This hybrid strain is based in the United States and is a cross between OG Kush, Purple Urkle, and Killer Queen. Although it’s a pretty balanced 50/50 blend, users note heavy indica effects as you’ll be happy yet super relaxed.Green Monster features buds that are incredibly dense, making it a strain that’s heavy hitting. Its THC content is typically around 27% or so and is advised for experienced smokers only because of how intense the high can be. You’ll notice a pretty natural blend of smells and tastes with Green Monster, with notes of pine, earth, and woody scents all blending together. A rather chemical aftertaste can come into play with little tinges of tar at the end.Users who want common sativa effects like happiness and euphoria will certainly get that with Green Monster, as it provides a relaxed high that will put a smile on your face. Yet as an indica-heavy hybrid, some of the more sedating effects will soon kick in. Get ready to experience your existential thoughts in their truest form, as many note that they have a hard time keeping a grasp on reality as Green Monster takes over.

Individuals who struggle with a lack of appetite often rely on Green Monster due to how hungry it can make you, and others in the medical cannabis community rave about its ability to relieve depression, insomnia, chronic pain, and migraines.As is common with many intense highs, smoking Green Monster will most likely leave you with cottonmouth and the potential for dry eyes. Smoking too much often leads to paranoia, and users might feel dizzy with a bit of a headache. Don’t let that stop you though, as the ultimate relaxation it brings is well worth it.Cultivating Green Monster on your own might be a bit difficult, as it’s a strain that’s known for being a little bit temperamental. Plants won’t yield an abundance of bud, yet it is safe to say that a moderate amount of product can be expected. This strain has a fairly average flowering cycle that comes in at around 56 days.Green Monster isn’t for the faint of heart, or head for that matter, so be sure to use it carefully and prepare yourself for a potentially transcendental experience. Have the snacks handy, some water nearby, and enjoy the long and mellow high.\n"

Diesel is only slightly detected when smoking, and it’s not enough to put off even the pickiest user.Lemon Pie could be coined as a great social strain, as its high starts off slow yet builds to an energetic and relaxing place. You might find yourself talking up a storm or simply feeling full of ambition and purpose, and all sense of worry will fade away.

        "description": "Wind down for a super mellow evening with Money Maker, a hybrid strain created by Strain Hunters, the geniuses who came up with the great strain, Afgooey. They’ve crossed Master Kush, Hindu Kush, and Skunk #1 to create a pretty potent plant that gives you a happy and heavy high right off the bat. An indica-dominant strain weighing in at 70/30, it brings users moderate THC levels for both medicinal and recreational use.Money Maker averages at about 20% THC and can top out at 23%, meaning you get a high that’s in your face and is best experienced by more seasoned users. A yummy smelling bud, it has strong notes of berries and spice that some say are reminiscent of fruitcake. Nuts, earth, and pine all blend together for a smell and taste that make it a joy to smoke. It’s also as pretty as it tastes, with minty cone-shaped nugs that are thick with frosty trichomes. Pistils are bright and in your face, just calling out for you to take a hit.Because of its relatively high THC levels, many users prefer to save Money Maker for bedtime, or at least later into their evening. Its high comes on strong and hard, leaving you feeling couch-locked yet clear enough to have rather existential thoughts about the meaning of life. You’ll be super relaxed and happy, and before sleepiness sets in, you may get very hungry. Be sure to keep your fridge fully stocked before smoking Money Maker, as it’s great for helping those with poor appetites.If you’re suffering from chronic pain, depression, or anxiety you’ll find welcome relief with Money Maker, as its powerful sedating effects are just the thing to take the edge off with a cerebral high. As you come down you’ll likely feel pretty tired, which makes this a great strain to smoke an hour or two before bed.Money Maker grows fast and can produce a surprisingly large yield for being such a short little plant. It’s a lover of all sorts of climates and soil types, making it easy to grow for beginners and a cash crop for those who grow commercially, making its name rather appropriate. After a moderate 8-week flowering cycle, you’ll find that branches need to be supported to hold the dense and heavy flowers.Plan your night accordingly before spending it with Money Maker, as you’ll come down into a sleepy and blissful state. Utilize the high to relieve yourself from a stressful day, zone out for a bit, and maybe have a few delicious snacks. Beginners should go easy on this lovely strain, but more experienced smokers will find it completely hits the spot.\n"

        "description": "If you’re craving a high like no other, Moonshine Haze will certainly do the trick. Winner in the Best Sativa category at the 2011 High Times’ Cannabis Cup, it only takes one hit before you’ll instantly learn why this strain is named after the bootleg booze that’s often brewed in bathtubs. Rare Dankness Seeds, located in Colorado, created this super sativa-dominant hybrid by crossing Nevil’s Wreck and Amnesia Haze, resulting in a perfect smoke for daytime use.Moonshine Haze isn’t one to mess with, as its high THC levels will mess right back with you if you aren’t careful. Ranging anywhere from 20% to 25%, it brings users a powerful high that you feel right away along with a delicious smell and taste. Strong with fruity, citrus, and sweet notes, many can distinctly pick out scents of grapefruit and also detect a bit of an earthy woody smell. Its flavor is crisp upon exhale and has an overall pleasing quality.This strain is as pretty as it is powerful, with bright green nugs completely covered in thick white trichomes. Super bright pistils are prevalent along this medium-sized bud, and you’ll be immediately hit with energy and awareness after smoking it. Moonshine Haze tends to come on strong, allowing you to feel uplifted yet relaxed, and giving you the fuel you need to be productive. You’ll thrive in social situations as you’re feeling ultra euphoric, yet some might completely space out if they overdo it.As the cerebral high transitions into a full body relaxation, you might end up with a case of couch-lock. This laziness is often desired by those who experience depression or stress, so Moonshine Haze can become a lifesaver for some. Both pain and fatigue are treated nicely with this strain, and individuals who struggle with their appetite can also find some relief. Keep the water nearby, as you’ll probably come down with a pretty good case of dry mouth.Moonshine Haze tends to be pretty cooperative, yet with a longer flowering cycle of 10 to 12 weeks, growers need to be patient and treat this beauty right. Expect plans to get tall and wide, meaning you’ll need a decent amount of room to cultivate this hydroponic lover.If you need to be laser focused and energetic in a social situation, this strain will work wonders for you. Chronic pain relief and mellow relaxation can also be found with Moonshine Haze, but just be sure to plan your activities accordingly. Your burst of energy will eventually give way to a lazy vibe, ultimately providing a balanced experience.\n"

        "description": "Smoke your cares away with the ultimate strain for relaxation - OG 18. This indica-dominant hybrid weighs in at 70/30 and will certainly allow you to unwind after a long day with ease. It’s won multiple awards, including the High Times’ Cannabis Cup in 2009 and 2010, as well as earning victories at the Spannabis Indoor Hydro Cup and the Europe Champions Cup both in 2010.DNA Genetics created this powerful strain, also known as Private Reserve, as a phenotype of OG Kush, bringing along with it some typical diesel like flavors. It ranks fairly moderately when it comes to THC, averaging about 18%, but can create some psychedelic effects if it’s overdone. Buds of OG 18 are sticky and dense with a super pungent smell of diesel and sour earthy notes. While the taste is just as potent, it’s not completely off-putting to more experienced smokers.OG 18 brings a strong head high pretty instantaneously, allowing any lingering stress or worries to melt away. Don’t expect to be too terribly productive after hitting this strain, as you’re more than likely going to be in an ultra-relaxed state of mind. You’ll feel OG 18 in both your head and body, and while you’ll most likely be pretty sedated, your mind will be happy, clear, and you might come down with the giggles.As your high starts to fade away, you’ll most likely feel rather hungry, which makes this strain ideal for those with appetite concerns. Others in the medical cannabis community love the stress relieving properties and the overall reduction in pain, inflammation, and help with mental health concerns. Although many find they are clear-headed and euphoric on OG 18, it should be noted that this is still a strong and long-lasting high that will completely calm your body. It’s often used before bed to help with insomnia, although others find they can function fairly normally while high.OG 18 is cooperative when it comes to growing, doing well in a greenhouse, indoors, or outside. Highly resistant to mold and mildew, it grows best in Mediterranean climates but will pretty much thrive when in the hands of even the most novice of growers. Plants will reach between 3 and 5 feet and put out a pretty decent yield, and its flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks is ideal.Whether you need to get away from nagging life concerns or you woke up with chronic pain, OG 18 is a jack of all trades. Make sure to use moderation with this strain, and prepare yourself for an uplifting experience that gently and slowly fades away as you come back down to reality.\n"

A 50/50 hybrid of Orange Skunk and something unknown, it’s fallen out of popularity so much to the point that it’s termed as discontinued. Why that’s the case is foreign, because this mild strain offers a taste sensation along with great effects like none other.THC levels of Orange Velvet can vary a bit, with lows around 15% and highs reaching close to 22%. Previously named “Melvin,” it was later changed to the name we now know it as, probably to increase its appeal. Nugs of this strain smell exactly like an orange creamsicle, with tones of orange, vanilla, honey, earth, and a bit of sourness to it. The taste is far more pleasant, only capturing the yummy flavors that make up the delicious frozen treat.Nugs of this strain are perfect for beginners and experienced smokers alike, as it provides a slight euphoric lift that’s kept in check. You’ll be happy and calm rather than a giggling mess that’s apparently taken one too many hits. Creativity and focus are vastly improved on Orange Velvet, as users note they can remain engaged in an activity for 2 to 3 hours before the high fades and they return to normal life.Since Orange Velvet offers a subtle mind and body relaxation as well, it’s ideal for those who need mild pain management. Hitting far less hard than many other hybrids out there, it’s ideal for someone who needs to take the edge off of a headache or unwind after a stressful day at work. Anxiety and depression are easily alleviated with Orange Velvet, and those undergoing chemotherapy will rejoice in its ability to stimulate one’s appetite.Good luck growing this strain at home, as Orange Velvet has all but fallen off the radar. Those lucky enough to get their hands on it can expect a moderately easy time cultivating it and a high yield once it’s completed flowering.Orange Velvet can be thought of as a soft and delicate strain, as it brings an uplifted feeling without many of the negative side effects associated with getting high. Occasional pain, PMS, or fatigue will be combated with ease, but those who suffer from chronic pain are better off finding something a little more potent. The next time you see Orange Velvet, buy in bulk as it’s incredibly hard to come by.\n"

Flowers will get rather heavy and large, so be sure to keep an eye on them as they grow.

        "description": "With a rich history dating back to a 1994 best hybrid win at the High Times’ Cannabis Cup, Silver Pearl is a favorite in Amsterdam coffee shops. Sensi Seeds developed this 80/20 sativa-dominant strain by crossing Early Pearl, Skunk, and Northern Lights #5 to create a plant that delivers strong mental effects.Possessing a moderate THC level, 16% on average, Silver Pearl shouldn’t be thought of as a weak strain. Its attractive notes of sweet citrus, honey, and spice are accented by a noticeable skunky aroma, yet it tastes slightly more herbal and earthy upon exhale. Many note that it smells of chocolate and tastes of honey, yet flavors and scents seem to vary. Nugs of Silver Pearl are quite a sight, as they’re sticky with a ton of bright hairs and layers upon layers of trichomes.Looking for a mellow high that eases you into a dreamy sleep? It’s best to look somewhere else then, as Silver Pearl is known as a great wake-and-bake bud. It hits you instantly with a head high that boosts your mood and gets your mind going, yet can create strong psychedelic effects for inexperienced users. While Silver Pearl allows you to get things done and flesh out any lingering thoughts you may have had, it doesn’t provide a focused high like other hybrids. Instead, you’ll find yourself bouncing from one thing to the next before settling into a lethargic relaxation that starts to slow down your mind.When used in moderation, this strain is great for those who suffer from stress and anxiety since it engages the feel-good part of your brain. Keep in mind that higher doses of Silver Pearl can induce anxiety, so those with the condition should use caution. Fatigue, pain relief, and even a poor appetite can also be helped tremendously from this strain, although it may not be quite as powerful for chronic pain as others.Novice growers will think they’ve hit the jackpot with Silver Pearl, as it is easy to manage as long as it’s cultivated indoors. It has a tendency to flower after only 7 weeks, and sometimes sooner, so it’s a great strain to get your growing skills fine-tuned. Plants top out at an adequate height and can produce a fairly large yield.If you have the time to be high for hours, Silver Pearl is a great choice. Many users report its effects last for at least two to three hours with a nice mixture of uplifting and relaxing effects. Use in moderation for help with easy to complete tasks or pain relief before settling in for a functional but relaxing high.\n"

        "description": "Blending a unique flavor with sativa and indica effects, Sour Apple is a strain you have to try. Originally created by Top Shelf Seeds, there are a few variations of this 80/20 indica-dominant hybrid out there. Sour Diesel is always in the mix, but sometimes it’s crossed with Cinderella 99 while other times Pure Kush shows up. Either way, it produces a strain that’s great for relaxation for both day and evening use.THC levels vary quite a bit with Sour Apple, showing up anywhere between 14% and 27%. Approach this strain with caution, as its smell can trick you into thinking it’s all fun and games while a strong high catches you off guard. True to its name, Sour Apple smells and tastes just like a tart sour apple, although the flavor sweetens a bit upon exhaling with some citrus undertones. Buds are super frosty and have a long and narrow shape with a gentle dusting of amber pistils. Many describe them as fluffy looking and are rather sticky.Unlike other hybrids, the high that comes with Sour Apple builds slowly instead of hitting you in the face. You’ll begin to notice an uplifting cerebral effect that brings about a sense of happiness, focus, and social tendencies.

While mild pain like cramps and headaches will be relieved by this strain, it’s not as effective on severe and chronic pain like other hybrids out there. Still, it’s worth trying if you’ve had a particularly hard day and want to unwind and detach from the world for a while.Sour Apple is pretty easy to grow and prefers warm climates to truly thrive. It can be cultivated inside or outdoors and yields a nice harvest after 7 to 9 weeks. Those who grow outside and are concerned about privacy should note that Sour Apple’s plants can get up to 13 feet tall, so opting for indoor growth at a maximum 5-foot height might be a better way to go.A tasty bud for weeknight relaxation, Sour Apple offers a nice mix of productive focus and mellow stress relief. Wait a bit for the high to settle in before you go crazy with it, and enjoy the balanced effects it brings.\n"

        "description": "Bubblegum Kush is a mostly indica strain with thoroughly relaxing effects and a tangy flavor profile. Created in the Netherlands by Bulldog Seeds, this hybrid is a cross between the fruity Bubble Gum and none other than OG Kush. With a high that leans toward the relaxing end of the spectrum, this is definitely a strain better suited to kicking back than to being out and about. Bubblegum Kush’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 23%.Bubblegum Kush has impressive buds that are medium-sized and hold a spindle-like shape, bulging in the middle but tapered at both ends. These buds are unmistakably indica, with a densely-packed structure in which the leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark yellowish-green and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Finally, like bubblegum itself, Bubblegum Kush is very stick due to its thick coating of translucent white trichomes. This high resin content makes the bud very difficult to break up by hand.Consumers expecting the sugary scent of bubblegum may be surprised to find that Bubblegum Kush has a predominantly citrus aroma, with top notes of sour lemon and orange. There is, however, an underlying sweetness as well, a testament to the influence of award-winning parent strain Bubblegum. Meanwhile, grinding up the buds gives off some musky and earthy odors. When combusted, Bubblegum Kush gives off a thick smoke that can be harsh on the lungs, inducing coughing. On the exhale, this smoke tastes sweet and citrusy.Bubblegum Kush offers a slow, creeping high that may take as long as 15 minutes to reveal its presence. Eventually, smokers may notice a flushing in the cheeks, as well as a tingle around the temples and forehead. Some also describe an increase in salivation. Once these sensations pass, a well-prepared consumer can settle into a calm and even headspace. Any outside worries and stressors begin to dissolve into the background. Physical signs of anxiety are alleviated as well -- users may feel a release of a lingering muscular tension, as well as an improved capacity for breathing deeply and easily. Bubblegum Kush is not known to trigger intense bouts of deep thinking. As such, it’s neither liable to nudge smokers toward paranoia nor is it appropriate for achieving productivity. Instead, mellow-minded users can savor this bud for its ability to intensify the perception of certain sights and sounds. It can be a great way to appreciate a favorite album or a trippy or scary movie. Otherwise, Bubblegum Kush’s mental effects are marked by a giddiness that can be exuberant, if not exactly high-energy. The strain’s giggly mood can be very much at home in rowdy social situations. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Bubblegum Kush tends to paralyze smokers with couchlock; in the right circumstances, it can even pack them off to dreamland. Because of its mostly sedative vibes, Bubblegum Kush is best savored after dark.Bubblegum Kush’s relaxing effects can also have therapeutic value for medical cannabis patients. Its feeling of tranquility can temporarily lessen the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. It can also numb deep-seated aches and pains, as well as minor everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. For some, Bubblegum Kush can stoke the appetite, proving useful to chemotherapy patients. As noted, this strain can even combat insomnia, lull smokers into a deep and restful sleep. Thanks to its relative lack of cerebral side effects, Bubblegum Kush is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Bubblegum Kush are available online from Bulldog Seeds. The strain can be an easy, user-friendly grow for newcomers to cultivation. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These plants can grow short and bushy, and users may want to regularly trim away any fan leaves that can prevent light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Bubblegum Kush flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.Combining stress relief with euphoria and giddiness, it’s not wonder this strain is as popular as it is. Bubblegum Kush’s particularly high resin output can also be very useful in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Chocolate Diesel is an inventive strain that combines pungent favorite Sour Diesel and landrace-descended Chocolate Thai. This sativa-dominant hybrid mixes the wide-ranging influences of its parent strains to offer a high-flying, energetic experience. Chocolate Diesel also has a complex, multi-layered aroma that’s surprisingly pleasant and sweet. Luckily, though, this bud is more than just a novelty that sacrifices potency for flavor -- its THC content has been measured at between 13% and 23%.Chocolate Diesel is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that adhere to roughly circular shapes. Despite sativa genetics, these buds have a more indica-inflected appearance, with the densely-packed leaves creating a solid nugget. The coiled leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are run through with curly orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants in the wild. Finally, these flowers are covered in translucent white trichomes that give the flowers an icy sheen when seen from afar.When properly cured, Chocolate Diesel has an aroma that mixes gasoline-like fumes with a whiff of fresh pine. There are also some musky, hashy notes hanging underneath. Grinding up the tight buds gives off a faintly astringent chemical odor, a testament to the influence of Chemdawg in parent strain Sour Diesel’s lineage. As with other strains in the diesel family, Chocolate Diesel gives off a sour, acrid smoke that can make eyes water when it’s combusted in a pipe or a joint.This harsh smoke mixes flavors of cocoa and diesel on the exhale.Chocolate Diesel’s high hits quickly, filling the smoker’s tanks with a buzzy energy that’s hard to deny. At first, consumers may feel a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples. Once they grow accustomed to this odd sensation, they typically sense a change in their cognitive patterns. Thoughts may appear unbidden and then jump around from one to the next in free association. Similarly, some concepts may take on a new significance that can be hard to recreate or recall when the smoker is sober again. This kind of cerebral thinking is good for working through complicated analytical tasks, as well as for opening up barriers to creativity. Chocolate Diesel’s stimulation is more than just mental -- it can provide a distinct “get-up-and-go” physical energy as well. This buzzy effect, along with Chocolate Diesel’s ever-present mental chatter makes it a great accompaniment to mundane jobs like cleaning or grocery shopping. The strain’s energy and uplifting qualities also make it a good way to enhance social situations. It can spark conversation and camaraderie when shared with like-minded friends. With relatively few sedative effects, Chocolate Diesel is not likely to lay users out flat with laziness or drowsiness. Instead, it can be a good strain to enjoy with a cup of coffee as a wake-and-bake treat; if consumed before bed, Chocolate Diesel is certain to keep smokers awake and wired.Chocolate Diesel can also have wide-ranging benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its clear-headed sense of focus can aid concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. Its generally carefree and upbeat mood can also temporarily alleviate the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Chocolate Diesel’s anti-inflammatory properties can effective in numbing everyday irritations like headaches and indigestion. Because the cerebral “mindrace” that comes with its onset can be overwhelming for some, Chocolate Diesel is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Chocolate Diesel are available online on a somewhat limited basis. Prospective home growers can also obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” This bud can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success depends on a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Those cultivating the strain indoors should take care to trim back their plants early on in the vegetative stage; sativas tend to grow very tall and early pruning can keep their height under control. Also like many other sativas, Chocolate Diesel has a very long flowering time -- in this case, about 10 to 12 weeks.Chocolate Diesel’s fast-paced, euphoric effects can be a great way to enliven a mellow party. If you do bring this tasty bud out in public, be sure to bring enough, as its unique aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

These buds are medium to large in size and cling together in long, spade-like shapes, almost like mini pinecones. The leaves, which adhere closely together in an indica-typical bud structure, are remarkable for their color: a mottled combination of mossy green and rich purple and lavender. These latter hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics that trigger the release of blue and purple shades when stimulated by cold weather. These already-colorful buds are also threaded through with yellow pistils and coated in cloudy white trichomes that account for the strain’s psychoactivity.When properly cured, Grape Cookies has a pleasant aroma that mingles fresh berries with a floral sweetness. There are also some distinct notes of grape. Meanwhile, grinding up the attractive buds yields the somewhat less appealing odor of diesel fumes. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Grape Cookies burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke carries the tastes of grapes, accented by an herbal, almost medicinal quality. Notably, any grape flavors present in this bud are totally incidental to its purple coloring -- while the plants’ color is determined by pigments, its aroma is dictated by different compounds called terpenes.Grape Cookies offers smokers what might be described as a “creeper” of a high, taking as many as 10 to 15 minutes to reveal its effects. As the high sets in, the user may note inexplicable feelings of euphoria and positivity. This upbeat emotional state is accompanied by an odd pressure around the temples and cheeks. As users become accustomed to these newfound sensations, they can also detect some significant changes in their perception. Certain sights and sounds may take on a new intensity that can occupy the smoker’s attention for quite a while. Many consumers also describe a palpable feeling of time dilation or a visual warping of depth perception. In addition to these sensory novelties, Grape Cookies brings about a slight increase in mental stimulation. Thoughts and ideas may flow more quickly than usual and may take on a new, ineffable significance. Far from cerebral, though, Grape Cookies is unlikely to leave users acute enough to execute complicated analytical tasks; this is not a strain for enhancing productivity. Instead, the bud’s head high is dreamy and lazy, especially as its bodily effects become more pronounced. As the high progresses, waves of relaxation roll down the neck and spread through the spine and core. This sedation may inspire users to take a load off in the closest comfortable surroundings. Under the right circumstances, Grape Cookies can cause both couchlock and sleep. For these reasons, the strain is best enjoyed at night.Grape Cookies can also have therapeutic value for medical cannabis patients. Its sedation can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia and arthritis. As noted, the strain can also lull consumers into a deep and fulfilling sleep. Psychologically speaking, it can even temporarily take the edge off of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because its mental effects are unlikely to bring about the kind of recursive thinking that leads to paranoia, Grape Cookies is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Although Pisces has made seeds of Grape Cookies available for sale online, availability is subject to changes in stock levels. Another option for prospective growers is to obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors requires a semi-humid, almost Mediterranean climate. The crops tend to grow short and bushy and can be easily accommodated indoors. Those looking to bring out Grape Cookies’ full purple potential should expose the plants to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees below average. Grape Cookies flowers within 9 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Grape Cookies is a must-try for indica lovers, as well as for connoisseurs of the rare purple cannabis flower. This richly-scented strain is a surefire path to luxurious relaxation.\n"

        "description": "While it may not have the wide distribution of its namesake soda, Grape Crush certainly deserves to. Sometimes spelled Grape Krush, this indica-dominant hybrid is derived from fruity staple Blueberry and carries all of its predecessor’s flavor and potency. Grape Crush was created by the infamous DJ Short, who has also given us Vaniluna and Flo. Those lucky enough to try this eye-catching strain can count on smooth, sedative effects that are said to last longer than average. Grape Crush’s THC levels have been charted at between 10% and 19%It’s hard to deny the visual appeal of Grape Crush’s vivid flowers. They are generally medium in size and hold an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. These spindly flowers have a surprisingly sativa-like bud structure, with their fluffy leaves clinging loosely to their central stems. The leaves themselves are this strain’s tour de force -- more often than not, they are a veritable camouflage pattern of green and dark purple. The latter hues are due to pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics which can trigger vivid colors when stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, snowy white trichomes cap off these impressive flowers, accounting for their psychoactivity and making them very sticky to the touch.Unsurprisingly perhaps, Grape Crush’s predominant aroma is of juicy, slightly sour grapes. There’s also a pervasive sweetness that’s so strong as to border on smelling rotten or fermented. Grinding up these distinctive buds releases a hashy and spicy odor that betrays this bud’s Kush roots. Grape Crush burns with a smooth and agreeable smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. This smoke tastes herbal and almost tea-like on the exhale. Those toking in public may want to take some precautions, as Grape Crush can be particularly pungent.Grape Crush’s high builds slowly and make take as many as 15 minutes after users have savored its fruity smoke before revealing its effects. At first, the eyes and temples may begin to tingle and the face flushes slightly. There is often an increased weighty feeling in the limbs and eyelids; this is especially noticeable if users have been sitting down and then attempt to stand up or move. Grape Crush’s high isn’t entirely sleepy and physical -- there are discernible mental effects, ranging from a preoccupation with certain ideas and concepts to a trippy distortion in visual or auditory perception. For the most part, though, Grape Crush will not be helpful in focusing the mind on a mountain of task-based analytical work. Instead, enjoy this fruity bud as a way to daydream, brainstorm, and pore over the mysteries of life. As time passes, waves of relaxation roll gently down from the neck and out through the core and limbs. In this sense, Grape Crush provides a great excuse for kicking back and starting a binge-watching session. Best savored after a long day or week of work, this strain can be nice for some introspective solo time as well as for chummy, giggly hang sessions with like-minded friends. When boosting their dosage, smokers should plan on being pinned to the couch for the foreseeable future. Because of its taper down in energy, this is one strain that’s best enjoyed during the early evening or nighttime.Grape Crush can also have several uses for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s mellow, numbing properties can temporarily soothe the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It may also be effective as a painkiller, for both deep-seated, chronic pain, and everyday irritations like headaches and indigestion. In the right set and setting, Grape Crush can even counteract stubborn cases of insomnia, lulling smokers to sleep. Because it is more dreamy and dopey than cerebral, Grape Crush is a good option for those who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low THC tolerance. Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Grape Crush are available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The short and bushy plants are easily accommodated in limited indoor spaces. Those looking to bring out this bud’s striking purple potential should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least 10 degrees below average. Grape Crush flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late October when grown outdoors.An indica with serious bag appeal, be prepared to share Grape Crush if you’re consuming it in public. This strain is a must-try, if only for its unique coloring.\n"

        "description": "Green Candy is a sativa-dominant hybrid that’s perfect for kicking off an active, high-powered day. Although its original breeders are unknown, this strain is said to be a cross between Kandy Kush and the notorious Green Crack. A potent herb for even experienced cannabis consumers, Green Candy is well-suited to a wide variety of daytime activities. Its robust, berry-tinged aroma is a pleasant fringe benefit to its long-lasting effects. This strain’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Green Candy sets itself apart with impressively large flowers that hold an almost pyramidal shape, tapering from a broad base down to a pointed tip. These buds have a marked sativa structure, with the piecey leaves adhering together relatively loosely; they can be easily torn away from their central stems. These fluffy leaves are a vivid yellow-green and are twisted through with rust-colored pistils. Finally, a coating of amber trichomes lies on top of these flowers, giving them a luminous golden glow.When they’re properly cured, a decidedly sweet and fruity odor wafts up from Green Candy’s flowers. This pleasant scent is undercut by some dank base notes, redolent of musk and damp earth. Grinding up or picking apart the flowers yields a tangy and skunky aroma, possibly passed on from parent strain Green Crack. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Green Candy gives off a smooth and easily ingested smoke. This smoke leaves behind a taste that mixes skunky and berry-like flavors on the exhale.As may be expected of this sativa-dominant plant, Green Candy’s high takes effect quickly. Almost immediately, the bud exerts a pressure around the upper face and temples, with the dreaded side effect of red-eye occurring relatively early in the high. Those who may have been calm and relaxed prior to smoking may find themselves suddenly somewhat jittery, compelled to get up and move. Users may find themselves distracted by the suddenly boosted volume of their own internal monologue. This mental chatter can jump from one thought to the next in a freely-associative manner. For some users, this increased cerebral thinking may result in talkativeness, especially in the presence of like-minded (or similarly intoxicated) friends. A percentage of smokers may find Green Candy’s mindrace to be overwhelming or disorienting, though, and may need to take some solo time in secluded surroundings to recoup. In the right set and setting, however, this mindful strain can be a good way to power through a mountain of work-related tasks. Alternatively, Green Candy’s energetic effects can be helpful for enhancing activities like exercise -- or, if the mood is right, sex. This strain comes with very few physical effects, with only a few consumers describing feelings of mild relaxation. A good wake-and-bake option, Green Candy is also appropriate for afternoon use. If used shortly before bed, it’s liable to keep smokers wide awake.Green Candy’s buzzy, alert properties can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s long-lasting sense of focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. This bud can also temporarily lift the spirits of those suffering from mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, some anti-inflammatory properties can take the sting out of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because its recursive patterns of thinking can easily veer into paranoia, Green Candy is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.As no breeders have produced Green Candy on a commercial scale, seeds of the strain are not available for sale online. Prospective growers must obtain clippings from healthy plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical clones. This strain can be grown indoors or out, although its sativa genetics may especially thrive outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Green Candy’s sativa character also suggests that its plants can grow very tall and may need to be trimmed back early in the vegetative stage to fit in indoor spaces. Tasty, potent, and more innocently named than its parent strain Green Crack, Green Candy is a must-try for sativa lovers. Try bringing it on a camping trip, as its energetic, expansive properties can be especially at home in the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "Not to be confused with the THC-infused beer concoction of the same name, Green Dragon is a pure indica with strong, relaxing effects. The brainchild of breeder Master Thai, who is also responsible for the popular Tahoe genetic line, this strain is a cross between an Afghani indica landrace and resinous Turkish Gummy. With a totally indica genetic backbone, Green Dragon promises smokers therapeutic and thorough sedation, alongside a bouquet of incense and spice. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of Green Dragon to have between 12% and 16% THC.Green Dragon sets itself apart with particularly large flowers. The chunky buds adhere to a roughly spherical shape and have the dense structure usually associated with other indica strains -- the tightly-coiled leaves curl inward toward their central stems, forming a solid nugget. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and some phenotypes even boast flashes of purple. These latter hues are due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments in the bud’s genetics that trigger colorful shades when activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover the outer surfaces and inner nooks and crannies of Green Dragon’s flowers, giving them an icy-looking sheen.Green Dragon burst with a sweet aroma when properly cured. This scent can be so cloying as to verge on dank and fermented. Hanging out underneath are some woodsy base notes of pine.Meanwhile, grinding up the strain’s thick flowers releases a peppery, hashy odor, thanks to the influence of parent strain Afghani. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Green Dragon burns with an acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and make smokers’ eyes water. On the exhale, this smoke tastes lightly herbal with a touch of pine freshness. Those consuming this bud in public may want to take some precautions, as its odor can carry for quite a distance.Given its indica nature, Green Dragon’s high kicks in relatively quickly. Shortly after savoring (or coughing up) the strain’s rich smoke, consumers may feel a concerted pressure around the temples and eyes. This sensation soon melts into a holistic feeling of full-body relaxation. Users may notice a dissipation in any lingering muscular tension and may find themselves able to breathe more deeply and easily. Some mental effects can be detected in the form of sensory distortion -- users may notice that their depth perception is slightly off or that certain sights and sounds take on a new intensity. Other cognitive sensations include a dreamy, hazy mindset that’s well-suited to daydreaming and brainstorming but not too efficiently executing complicated, work-related tasks. For the most part, though, Green Dragon takes action on the user’s body, sending waves of painkilling sedation down through the neck and radiating out through the spine and core. Smokers become easily suggestible and prone to seeking horizontal refuge on the closest comfortable couch. As the high progresses, couchlock and sleep both become increasingly likely. It should come as no surprise, then, that Green Dragon is best consumed at night.Green Dragon’s soothing properties can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its easygoing mood can temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Its ability to relax the body can also take care of aches and pains, whether they’re chronic and disease-related, or minor, like headaches. As noted, Green Dragon can even induce sleep, serving as a potent antidote to insomnia. Because it isn’t likely to send the user into obsessive, recursive thinking patterns, Green Dragon is a good option for patients who have a low THC tolerance or who are prone to panic and paranoia.Fortunately for home growers, Master Thai has made seeds of Green Dragon available online. Once obtained, it can grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The plants tend to grow short and bushy, and growers should keep an eye out for broad fan leaves that might prevent nutrients and light from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Green Dragon flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.Green Dragon’s lazy, friendly vibes are great for sharing with like-minded friends over some drinks or a binge-watching session. This is one sleepy dragon that’s perfectly safe to chase.\n"

        "description": "Green Dream is a sativa-dominant hybrid that relies on some powerful genetics to reach impressive new heights of euphoria and healing. Although its original breeder is undocumented, this strain is known to be a cross between the uber-popular Blue Dream and notorious sativa Green Crack. With an enduring high and a complex aroma that mixes citrus and floral accents, there’s no denying this bud’s appeal to indica and sativa lovers alike. Green Dream’s THC content has been measured at between 11% and 24%.Green Dream’s flowers are dreamy indeed -- colorful and particularly large in size. These chunky buds adhere in elongated spindly shapes, something like miniature cypress trees. The flowers have a distinctly sativa structure, with loose, ragged-looking leaves that can be easily torn away from their central stems. These fluffy leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are twisted through with a particularly high volume of orange-brown pistils. Finally, a crown of cloudy white trichomes makes these flowers very sticky and hard to break up without the use of a quality grinder.The primary aroma wafting up from Green Dream’s flowers is musky and earthy, similar to wet soil. On closer inspection, there’s also a bright citrus undertone that spices up the overall impression. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers releases a skunky odor that may have been passed on from parent strain Green Crack. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Green Crack gives off a pleasantly smooth smoke. This smoke has a lemony flavor, along with some of the flowery and fruity essence that makes parent strain Blue Dream so popular.Green Dream’s high takes effect quickly, initially manifesting as a throbbing around the temples and forehead, as well an increased production of saliva. These physical effects are matched by a pronounced change in sensory perception. External stimuli may seem sharper or take on odd new dimensions. Additionally, smokers may experience ineffable phenomena like time dilation or visual distortions. Once they adjust -- if they’re able -- to these sensations, consumers may feel a shift in their thinking as well. Certain ephemeral thoughts and concepts may occupy more attention than they otherwise might, making this strain a great way to enhance brainstorming and working on open-ended creative projects. On the other hand, this kind of thinking can lead to an inordinate focus on unpleasant or unproductive thoughts, plunging susceptible users into panic or paranoia. In the right set and setting, however, Green Dream’s cerebral mindset can be an effective way to accomplish work-related tasks, as well as to add some color to mundane activities like cleaning the house. As the high wears on, some palapble physical relaxation creeps in as well. While smokers may not necessarily be pinned in place, they may be able to detect a decrease in deeply-held physical tension. This holistic stimulation can be good for activities that involve both physical and mental coordination, including exercising and playing video games. Because of its gradual decrease in energy, Green Dream is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening.Green Dream’s versatile effects can have wide-reaching application for medical cannabis patients as well. Its lucidity and focus can be an asset to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on single tasks. The strain’s mood-elevating properties can also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Green Dream’s mild physical relaxation may soothe aches and pains, whether they’re chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or lupus, or temporary, as due to injury. As noted, this strain’s cerebral mindrace may be unwelcome for some -- particularly, for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Seeds of this strain are not available from online retailers. As such, prospective growers should seek out a trusted source from which to obtain clippings of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Green Dream’s plants tend to be short and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Indoor growing should occasionally “top” their plants, by trimming away light-blocking fan leaves that could prevent the flowering of any low-growing nodes. Green Dream flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Green Dream’s smooth combination of effects makes it appealing to indica and sativa lovers alike. If you break this strain out in a social situation, be sure to bring enough to share, as its aroma is likely to attract attention.\n"

        "description": "Early Pearl is a mostly sativa strain that offers buzzy mental effects and a pungent, herbal aroma. The strain is the creation of breeders Sensi Seeds -- who have also given us Super Skunk -- and is one of three strain in their Early line (the others are Early Skunk and Early Girl). These varieties were specifically bred in the Netherlands in the 80s to survive in cool-weather locations. Unfortunately, Sensi has kept this strain’s genetics a proprietary secret -- but we do know that its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Early Pearl is marked by medium or large-sized flower that cling together in tapered shapes similar to miniature pinecones. These buds have a solid, indica-typical structure at their core, while their leaves twist outward loosely at their edges in a manner more often associated with sativas. The leaves themselves are a mossy green, although sometimes, phenotypes of Early Pearl show off flashes of indigo and purple. These surprising shades come about when anthocyanin pigments are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a blanket of icy white trichomes covers these dense buds, making them very sticky and difficult to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Early Pearl give off a sweet, almost floral aroma. On closer inspection, the dank, earthy scent of wood is also lurking underneath. Grinding up the strain’s tight buds releases some spicy, herbal scents, perhaps suggesting some Haze in Early Pearl’s background. When burnt, the bud gives off a thick, harsh smoke that is known to induce coughing. This smoke tastes sweet and tangy on the exhale.Unsurprisingly given its predominantly sativa lineage, Early Pearl takes effect rather quickly after consumers have finished coughing on its thick smoke. Its first physical manifestation arrive as a concerted pressure around the temples and lower forehead. This sensation is  soon accompanied by an uptick in cerebral thinking. Certain thoughts or concepts -- ones that might otherwise seem uninteresting -- may completely occupy the user’s attention. Similarly, smokers may find themselves making surprising new associations between certain ideas. This lucid, sharpened mindset can help in accomplishing a long list of tasks, whether they’re analytica and work-related or freewheeling and personal. The euphoria that comes with these effects can also improve mood and motivate the smoker to get up and exercise or go out to run some errands. Early Pearl’s high comes with relatively few physical effects, although after some time, users may feel some tingle of relaxation that rolls down the neck and spreads through the core and limbs. In certain cases, this combination of mild physical stimulation and mental energy makes the strain a great accompaniment to activities that involve both physical and mental alertness -- including exercise, dancing, and sex. Because of its mostly energetic properties, Early Pearl is recommended for use during the late morning or afternoon; if enjoyed just before bed, it’s liable to keep sleepy users awake and wired.Early Pearl can also have several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its clear headed feeling of focus can help boost concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. The bud’s sense of imminence may also help those with mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more consciously and presently. Physical benefits include anti-inflammatory properties that may soothe headaches and indigestion. While fewer that average users report an overactive feeling of mindrace with EArly Pearl, patients who are prone to panic or paranoia should nevertheless consume the bud with caution.Fortunately for home growers, Sensi has made seeds of Early Pearl available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out. Thanks to its selective, climate-specific breeding, this strain can be particularly resistant to temperature variations when grown outdoors. Growers looking to bring out this bud’s eye-catching purple hues should briefly expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering. Despite its name, Early Pearl does not reach maturity especially early, flowering within about 9 weeks when grown indoors. At harvest time, this strain offers growers a high yield.Early Pearl is a good option for sativa fans who don’t want to be overwhelmed by mindrace or panic. Somewhat difficult to come by, it’s worth picking up when spotted.\n"

        "description": "Green Love Potion is a heavily indica-dominant hybrid that delivers both potent sedation and a fragrant, soothing smoke. Created by Samsara Seeds, the prolific breeders who have given us Ultraviolet, the bud is a combination of two other indica strains: the herbal Lavender and the complex Black Domina. The result of this cross is a heady strain that allows for some lucidity and productivity despite its relaxation. Green Love Potion’s psychoactivity has been measured at between 11% and 24%.Green Love Potion is marked by relatively small flowers that cling together in roughly spherical shapes. The buds have a tight, indica-type structure, with their leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a vivid shade of spring green and are twisted through with hairy yellow and orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of this strain also show off patches of deep blue and purple -- these surprising colors are due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which release uncommon hues when activated by cold weather in a process similar to the changing of foliage in autumn due to depleted chlorophyll levels. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cap off these already-colorful buds and make them very hard to break up without a grinder.Whether or not you’ve imagined the aroma of a love potion before, Green Love Potion’s smell may surprise. When properly cured, flowers of Green Love Potion burst with a fresh pine bouquet. Herbal accents similar to sage or eucalyptus are also lurking underneath. Grinding up or breaking apart these tight nugs release a vaguely astringent, ammonia-like scent. When combusted, Green Love Potion burns with a harsh smoke that’s more likely than not to induce coughing. On the exhale, this smoke can have a sweet and piney taste on the exhale, somewhat like sap.Green Love Potion offers a creeper of a high that may take many minutes after users have sampled its rich smoke before revealing itself. Initial effects manifest as a sudden flushing in the face and an increase in salivation. Eventually, a tingly wave of relaxation may spread through the core and all the way out to the fingertips and toes. In addition to a weighty feeling in the legs, smokers may also notice their eyelids beginning to sag, regardless of any prior energy levels. This can be especially obvious to users who toke while sitting down -- suddenly standing up and attempting to move can trigger a powerful head rush. Green Love Potion’s body high is soon accompanied by an uptick in cerebral thinking. The user’s thoughts may jump from one to the next in fast succession or may become inordinately fixated on a single topic. Despite this mindrace, consumers are typically able to remain lucid and keep up with conversations and responsibilities. As such, Green Love Potion can be great for crossing things off of a long to-do list, including anything from analytical work-related tasks to mundane chores like doing the dishes. This strain’s stimulation of mental and physical energy is also good for activities that involve the use of both mind and body; indeed, as its name implies, Green Love Potion can be an aphrodisiac in the right circumstances. Note that as dosage is increased, couchlock is likely to take over and plunge smokers into a sedated trance. Because of its slow decrescendo of effects, this strain is best consumed between late afternoon and early evening.Green Love Potion’s versatile properties can also have some utility for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained feeling of concentration may aid focus for those with attention deficit disorders. Physiologically speaking, it can also soothe aches and pains, whether they’re chronic and nerve-related or relatively minor, like headaches. Because its early stages are associated with cerebral thinking, patients who are prone to panic or paranoia should consume Green Love Potion with some caution.Seeds of Green Love Potion can be obtained from several online retailers. The strain can be grown indoors or outdoors, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Its plants grow short and bushy and can be easily accommodated indoors. Green Love Potion flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and yields as much as 46 grams (or 1.6 ounces) or flower per square foot of plant.With a well-balanced high and strikingly colorful flowers, Green Love Potion is sure to find lovers from both indica and sativa fanbases. The strain’s high volume of resin can also be good for producing hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Incredible Bulk is a strain with both hefty flowers and big-time genetics. This indica-dominant hybrid is a three-way cross between Super Skunk, Green Spirit, and notoriously chunky Big Bud.Like Big Bud, Incredible Bulk provides very heavy yields of exceptionally large flowers. Created by Dr. Krippling (who also gives us Afghan Cow), this strain provides unmistakably sedative effects and an extremely pungent odor. Its THC level has been measured at between 12% and 24%.True to its name, Incredible Bulk’s flowers catch the eye with their remarkable size. These buds are very large and adhere in thick, pseudo-spherical formations, almost resembling golf balls. The fat nuggets have an indica-type structure, with all leaves densely packed and coiled inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a murky shade of dark green, although some phenotypes can also boast patches of light and dark purple. These latter colors are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics, which release blue and indigo hues when agitated by cold weather in the growing process. Finally, a carpet of icy white trichomes makes these large buds even more colorful and accounts for their high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Incredible Bulk’s flowers have a decidedly musky, earthy aroma. On closer inspection, there are also sharp hints of skunk. Grinding up or breaking apart the buds yields notes of fresh pine. Despite this combination of heavy, woodsy scents, though, Incredible Bulk gives off a smooth and palatable smoke when burnt. On the exhale, this smoke tastes piney with notably sour accents.Unlike Bruce Banner’s transformation into the Incredible Hulk, Incredible Bulk has a more subtle, gradual onset. Several minutes after consuming it, smokers tend to feel a growing pressure in the temples and around the eyes; some may also detect an increase in their salivation. Once familiarized with these odd sensations, smokers typically also detect a change in their sensory perception, with certain sights and sounds taking on new dimensions of intensity. Such trippy, heady effects can be amplified by the addition of spacey music or some visually engaging movies. Indeed, kicking back in front of the TV may be the only thing you’ll want to pursue once under the full weight of Incredible Bulk’s influence. With a very subtle head high, Incredible Bulk’s only discernible mental effects center on some cognitive free association, with users finding their attention drawn from one concept to the next in meandering succession. As such, this is not the best bud for accomplishing complex, work-related tasks, but it’s very good for open-ended creative brainstorming. As time passes or as dosage is increased, the strain’s through body high melts into a pervasive sense of couchlock, rendering any prior motivation irrelevant. Incredible Bulk is a good way to unwind at the end of a long day or week, whether you’re alone or with a small group of friends. Because of its sleepy vibes, this strain is best enjoyed at night.Incredible Bulk’s sedative properties may also have value for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily improve the acute symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It may also dull physical pain, whether chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis, or minor, like headaches. Under the right circumstances, the strain can even work against insomnia. Because it is not likely to induce paranoia through recursive, cerebral thinking, Incredible Bulk is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Incredible Bulk are available for sale online. It is considered an easy grow, resistant to all kinds of variables like temperature variation and changes in nutrient levels. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Incredible Bulk flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers a staggeringly high yield of anywhere from 56 to 93 grams (2 to 2.2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Enjoy this exceptional bud as a way to bask in luxurious relaxation. Be careful if you’re toking outdoors or in public, though, as Incredible Bulk’s pungency can easily attract unwanted attention.\n"

        "description": "Another winner from prolific breeders DNA Genetics, LA Chocolat is an indica-leaning hybrid. This bud crosses two of DNA’s most popular strains, indica LA Confidential and sativa Chocolope. The result is a flavorful, potent bud that offers a solid balance of effects. If not won over by its relaxing properties, smokers are sure to be drawn to its complex, chocolate-tinged flavor. LA Chocolat’s THC content has been measured at between 22% and 29%.LA Chocolat is marked by medium to large-sized buds that are formed like miniature pine trees, broad at the base, and tapering down to a pointed tip. The flowers have a structure common to many indicas, with their leaves densely and tightly packed together. The leaves themselves are a medium shade of olive green and are twisted through with vibrant orange pistils. Translucent white trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these solid flowers, giving them a dewy sheen and making them very hard to break up without a grinder.When first inspecting buds of LA Chocolat, consumers may be struck by notes of cocoa and coffee, with a smooth, nutty undertone. Another whiff reveals some dank earthiness, possibly due to the influence of the Afghani in parent strain LA Confidential’s lineage. Meanwhile, grinding up or cracking open these flowers yields the rich odor of spice and hash. When combusted, LA Chocolat burns with a smooth and palatable smoke. There are suggestions of sweet cocoa on the exhale.LA Chocolat takes effect in short order, at first manifesting as a light throbbing pressure around the temples and forehead. Users will also notice a change in their cognitive processes, with ephemeral thoughts of ideas occupying more brain space than they ordinarily might. Some warping of the senses is also possible, with many smokers describing psychedelic phenomena like time dilation or distorted depth perception. Alongside this mental stimulation is a gradually mounting feeling of relaxation, via a soothing tingle that rolls down the neck and radiates out through the core and limbs. The resulting sense of calm is not necessarily heavy enough to knock users out, but it can make them more passive and less energetic than they otherwise might have been. Because of the balance between these effects, LA Chocolat is good for anything from running errands to accomplishing a long list of work-based tasks to just unwinding after a long day of work. The strain’s combination of mental and physical stimulation is also a good way to enhance activities that require both mental and physical coordination, including exercise and sex. If the dosage is increased, smokers should expect to feel this strain’s physical properties become more intense. At this point, couchlock and eventual sleep are possible. Because of its slow comedown, LA Chocolat is recommended for consumption in the afternoon or evening.LA Chocolat may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its clearheaded focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. It may also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, this bud can dull pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. As noted, LA Chocolat can bring much-needed sleep to insomniacs. Because its onset is associated with some possible mindrace, this strain is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or anxiety.Fortunately for home growers, DNA Genetics has made seeds of LA Chocolat available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants to be short and bushy with wide lateral branching and can easily be accommodated indoors. LA Chocolat flowers within 8 weeks when grown indoorsLA Chocolat is good for a whole range of activities, whether you’re alone or hanging with friends.

        "description": "Pineapple Thai is a landrace-derived strain with a high that’s as exotic as its genetics. This pure sativa comes from a variety native to Thailand -- but instead of the earthy, potpourri-inflected scent of its predecessor, Pineapple Thai has an infusion of tropical aromas. It offers a long-lasting head high, while its high concentration of CBD makes it physically therapeutic as well. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 11% and 24%.Pineapple Thai can be distinguished by its elongated flowers. Although it is not as spindly as the famous “Thai stick” variety often associated with its parent strain, Pineapple Thai is certainly long and somewhat stick-like in appearance. The strain also has a bud structure characteristic of sativas, relatively ragged and piecey with leaves clinging loosely to their central stems. These fluffy leaves themselves are a vivid spring green and are twisted through with bright red pistils. Finally, amber-colored trichomes give the flowers a subtle yellow glow and make them very sticky to the touch.On first inspection, Pineapple Thai’s buds bloom with a sweet citrus aroma, one that has distinct notes of pineapple. A second whiff reveals some pervasive floral and tropical scents. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart the flowers gives off a herbal odor with some hints of mint, perhaps suggesting descent from a Haze variety. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Pineapple Thai has a very smooth and pleasant smoke. This smoke tastes like pineapple, with a slight peppery kick on the exhale. Those enjoying this bud in public should take some precautions, as it can be particularly pungent smoke.Smokers typically feel Pineapple Thai’s effects take hold very quickly. Initial manifestations can be detected as a concerted pressure around the temples and forehead, along with a feeling of slight dizziness. These sensations soon progress from the physical head itself to the ineffable mind, with the user’s thoughts seemingly elevated and jumping in fast succession from one to another. In this mindset, certain ideas may occupy more of the user’s attention than they otherwise might. Pineapple Thai can also induce the user to think in categories, compiling mental lists or links of associated concepts. The strain’s mindfulness lends itself to complicated, analytical tasks. As users are apt to feel energized under Pineapple Thai’s influence, the strain can also allow them to go about a busy agenda as it spices up otherwise boring activities like cleaning the house or running errands. For those in an active mood, this bud can be a good way to enjoy light to moderate exercise, ranging from a jog to a full-fledged hike.Unlike many pure sativas, Pineapple Thai has a palpable effect on the body as well -- this is the due the influence of the cannabinoid CBD, which introduces the potential for strong relaxation. While smokers won’t necessarily be incapacitated by these soothing properties, may they be more noticeably at ease, free of any muscular tensions or earlier mental preoccupations. Ultimately, though, Pineapple Thai is a strain best reserved for daytime use, as its cerebral character is liable to keep nighttime smokers awake and wired.Pineapple Thai’s medical properties flow from its thoughtful nature as well as from its high levels of CBD. The strain can aid focus for those with attention deficit disorders. It can also help to dull the symptoms of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, this strain can be an effective analgesic for anything from chronic, disease-related pain to minor irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can bring about recursive patterns of thinking and paranoia, Pineapple Thai is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Pineapple Thai does not seem to be grown for commercial seed production. Those looking to cultivate the strain at home should obtain clippings of mature plants from a trusted source in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” While Pineapple Thai can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate, it may particularly thrive outdoors thanks to its hardy landrace genes. Plants can reach heights of almost 15 feet; as such, those growing indoor should cut back their crops early in the vegetative stage in order to train them to fit in limited spaces. Like many sativas. Pineapple Thai can also have a very long flowering time, exceeding 10 weeks in some cases.Pineapple Thai’s agreeable, uplifting vibes make it welcome in both solo settings and more social environments. If you do break it out at a party, be prepared to share, as the bud’s tropical aroma is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Platinum Kush is a resinous strain worthy of its lofty title. This popular indica-dominant hybrid is derived from rock-solid OG Kush genetics and carries its parent strain’s memorable aroma. This is also a bud with serious bag appeal, often showing off vivid purple leaves. Platinum Kush offers consumers a pleasant balance of cerebral acuity and thorough relaxation. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has measured its THC content at between 13% and 17%.Platinum Kush sets itself apart with medium to large-sized nuggets that cling together in conical formations. These spade-like flowers have the densely-packed structure often associated with other indica-dominant varieties, with their leaves overlapping each other as they curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a pale sea green; some phenotypes of the strain also have patches of pale and dark purple in their leaves -- such surprising colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the plants’ genetics are stimulated by colder than average weather in the growing process. Finally, a blanket of silvery white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these dense flowers, giving them the platinum sheen referenced in their name.When properly cured, Platinum Kush can smell intensely sweet, verging on skunky, with a fermented edge. There is also an earthy, musky underpinning, keeping the aroma organic and grounded. When these thick flowers are ground up or broken open, they give off a tangy odor, reminiscent of mature cheese. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, these strong scents come together in a thick, harsh smoke that’s liable to induce coughing or watery eyes. Platinum Kush’s smoke tastes both sweet and acrid on the exhale.Platinum Kush offers a slow, creeping high and may take as many as 15 minutes after users have finished coughing on its smoke before revealing its force. Effects eventually emerge as a throbbing around the eyes and forehead. This sensation soon trickles down the neck and spreads through the core and limbs, making users feel weighed down. In addition to a sudden pervasive relaxation, users typically report a change in sensory perception. Visual and auditory amplification can be expected, as can some trippy phenomena like distorted depth perception or a strong sense of time dilation. As they acclimate to the force of this strain’s sedative and psychedelic power, smokers of Platinum Kush may also notice that their thoughts take on a newly elevated quality. Ideas may jump around in free association; occasionally, a single concept may assert itself to occupy more of the user’s attention than it otherwise might. Such head-focused effects make Platinum Kush a great bud to enjoy before tackling complex, analytical tasks, as well as more open-ended creative pursuits. However, due to its heavy and intractable body stone, this strain may prevent users from engaging in physical activity, whether it’s exercise or simply getting up and cleaning the house. Platinum Kush can be a great way to unwind after a long day, whether you’re alone or surrounded by like-minded friends. Its holistic high can help the smoker feel centered and refreshed. Because of its progression toward sleepiness, this strain is best consumed in the evening or nighttime.Platinum Kush’s versatile effects can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It numbing effect may temporarily soothe the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. In some cases, it can also help those with attention deficit disorder to sustain focus on any tasks at hand. On the physical side, Platinum Kush can soothe aches and pains, from the chronic and disease-related to more minor inflammatory annoyances. Even though this strain can be head-focused, it doesn’t often lead to recursive, paranoid thinking, making it good for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Since no commercial growers appear to have fostered Platinum Kush for large-scale seed production, prospective home growers should obtain clippings of the strain in order to grow identical “clones.” Although there is little information available regarding specific best practices for this strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Additionally, this bud’s indica background suggests both short, squat plants and a relatively brief flowering time.Platinum Kush is a must-try for indica lovers -- especially fans of potent OG genetics. Its versatile, multi-faceted high can either perk up the mind or slow down the body, depending on the user’s individual need.\n"

        "description": "Power Kush is a well-balanced hybrid that capitalizes on some legendary genetics. Developed by Dinafem Seeds, the same breeders who have given us Moby Dick and Blue Widow, Power Kush is a cross between an Afghani landrace indica and pungent staple Skunk. This strain delivers potent effects that lean toward the sedated, indica end of the spectrum. Its THC content has been measured at between 10% and 19%; Power Kush has also been found to have higher-than-average concentrations of the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD.Power Kush is marked by small to medium-sized flowers that adhere to a spade-like formation, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Some phenotypes show more elongated, tubular flowers than others. These buds seem to have a hybridized structure -- compact, but with their leaves spiraling loosely outward from their central stems, rather than curled tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are trailed throughout with orange and brown pistils. Cloudy white trichomes give the flowers a dewy sheen, as well as a very sticky texture, making them hard to break apart without a quality grinder.Power Kush’s predominant aroma is a fruity tang, with definite citrus overtones. Lurking underneath is a more acrid, skunky odor. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart the ragged buds reveals this strain’s Afghani roots, evident in the rich scent of spice and something like patchouli. Power Kush burns with a harsh, palate-stinging smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. This smoke tastes sweet and peppery on the exhale.Power Kush hits quickly with both barrels -- at the same time as users detect a mounting throb around the temples, they may notice an uptick in their cerebral thinking patterns. In the right set and setting, smokers’ internal monologues tend to kick into high gear, taking on a freely-associative character and often stopping to center on single topics. Indeed, this is a strain tailor-made for stoners who like to kick back and ruminate on life’s big questions. Despite all this introspection, though, Power Kush offers a formidable body high as well. Beginning in the neck and spreading down through the core and extremities, users may feel fred of any lingering physical tension. They may also feel weighed down and consequently seek out the closest comfortable surface on which to kick back and remain horizontal. Although Power Kush isn't’ likely to couchlock users right off the bat, it can sap the motivation to pursue more physically active tasks like exercising or running errands. Luckily, the strain leaves minds stimulated and alert, free to work on anything from analytical answers to problem-oriented tasks to brainstorming in the service of more rambling, creative projects. As the high progresses, however, this strain’s sedation can overpower even an engaged brain, simply zoning smokers out and leaving them content to kick back in peace. Because of its largely sleepy vibes, this is one strain best reserved for evening to bedtime use.These versatile effects can also be very useful for some medical cannabis patients. Its agreeable, uplifting mental properties can temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. Its thorough physical sedation can also soothe pain, whether it’s due to chronic disease or minor injury. In high enough doses, Power Kush can even lull insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because this strain’s cerebral onset can veer into paranoia in some circumstances, Power Kush is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance. Fortunately for home growers, Dinafem has made seeds of Power Kush available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants typically reach a medium height, although growers should be vigilant in trimming away broad fan leaves that can block light and air from nourishing low-growing, flowering nodes. Power Kush flowers in a brief 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and can offer up to 51 grams (or about 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Power Kush is a bud that’s sure to impress indica and sativa lovers alike. It’s as enjoyable in buzzy social situations as it is for mellow solo use.\n"

        "description": "Purple Berry is a fruity, potent strain descended from two taste-focused favorites. This indica-dominant hybrid is the product of Blueberry and Grandaddy Purple and carries all of its predecessors’ sweetness and robust flavor. On top of these perks, Purple Berry offers an enduring sedative high that’s just the thing for unwinding after a long day. The colorful strain has been found to have between 10% and 22% THC.Purple Berry’s buds are a visual delight. The flowers are medium to stunningly large in size and adhere in a tapered formation, rounded at the end, somewhat like miniature bullets. These buds are uniformly dense and compact, with their leaves spiral tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a true highlight, showing off mottled patterns of mossy green and deep indigo. Any lavender hues are the result of a pigment called anthocyanin, which can express blues and purples when agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a high concentration of glassy trichomes gives Purple Berry’s flowers a very sticky texture and a silvery sheen.When properly cured, Purple Berry gives off an unmistakably berry-tinged sweetness. Lurking underneath this bright aroma is an herbal character, with some notes of mint and sage. Meanwhile, grinding up these tight buds gives off a subtle earthy musk. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, this strain gives off a smooth and fruity smoke that tastes like sweet berries on the exhale, with a faint aftertaste of potpourri.Purple Berry’s mellow high reveals itself in stages, first manifesting as a mounting pressure around the eyes temples. Some smokers also report a flushing in the cheeks and a stimulation of the salivary glands. These odd sensations are soon met with changes in awareness. Some sights or sounds can take on a new dimension or intensity. Warped depth perception is also commonly reported. In these early stages, atmospheric media like a favorite album or a trippy movie can be powerful sensory experiences. While some users may fall into a pattern of sped-up, freely-associative thinking, Purple Berry typically has a more low-key effect on the brain, making smokers dreamy and easily confused. As the high progresses, Purple Berry also continues to work on the body, dissolving any lingering tension and facilitates deep, even breathing. This laid-back vibe is right at home in intimate social situations, sparking camaraderies and conversations when shared with like-minded friends. Don’t plan on plowing through a mountain of work or a long to-do list under this strain’s influence. Instead, consider it a happy hour treat or a midnight snack to soothe your tightly-wound mind.

It can temporarily take the edge off of harsh symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Physiologically speaking, it can also soothe pain, acting as a balm on sore muscles as well as an analgesic for chronic, disease-related pain. Purple Berry may also take care of lesser irritations, like headaches and nausea. In high enough doses, this strain can lull even insomniacs into a deep and fulfilling sleep. Because it doesn’t have the cerebral intensity of strains that lean more sativa, Purple Berry is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Unfortunately, seeds of Purple Berry are not available for sale online. Prospective home growers should obtain clippings for mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” Purple Berry can be grown indoors or out, although successful indoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

        "description": "Purple Bud is a potent indica-dominant hybrid that delivers exactly what its name promises. This colorful strain, created by prolific breeders Sensi Seeds -- reportedly the original creators of Jack Herer -- is the product of several landrace varieties. Its background entails genetics from Afghani, Jamaican, and Hindu Kush strains, as well as indica favorite Purple Kush. Besides colorful and aromatic flowers, Purple Bud offers consumers a very relaxing high. This strain’s THC levels have been reported at between 15% and 20%.Purple Bud’s flowers catch the eye right away. Usually medium to large in size, these buds have a pronounced spade-like shape, tapering down from a wide base into a pointed end. These compact nugs also have a classically indica bud structure, with their small leaves coiled tightly inward toward their central stems. Most importantly, the leaves themselves are green, mixed with shades of purple ranging from faint to deep indigo. These purple hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins, which can trigger the production of colors other than green when agitated by cold weather during the growing process. A coating of trichomes caps off these already-colorful buds, accounting for their psychoactivity.When properly cured, Purple Bud has a distinctly herbal character, with lavender and sage notes. There are also some dank and woodsy undertones that mellow out the strain’s overall impression. Meanwhile, grinding up these dense flowers releases the odor of spice and hash, likely passed on from parent strain Afghani. Purple Bud burns with a smooth, heavily perfumed smoke when it is combusted in a pipe or a joint. This smoke can tastes flowery with a hint of pine on the exhale. Notably, Purple Bud offers no distinct grape flavors -- this is because the pigments that create its color have no corresponding effect on its taste, which is determined by different compounds called terpenes.Purple Bud’s high takes effect slowly, taking several minutes after smokers have savored its pleasant clouds before revealing itself. Aside from odd physical sensations like a throbbing around the forehead, users may detect and uplift in mood. Involuntary smiling and heavy eyelids can be expected, along with a suddenly easygoing outlook. Some changes in sensory perception are also commonly reported, including an intensification of certain sights or sounds. A few users may even undergo such trippy phenomena as distortions depth perception and in their ability to gauge the passage of time. Aside from thom these sensory changes, Purple Bud does not significantly alter the user’s cognitive abilities. Rather than an increase in cerebral patterns of thinking, consumers tend to experience a more mild kind of mental stimulation. While you may not be able to execute complex tasks, your creative inhibitions may be lifted, allowing for deep daydreaming. As the high progresses, a soothing body melt sinks in, making this strain as physically therapeutic as it is mentally liberating. Fortunately, though, this strain allows the stimulated mind to remain active even as it starts to immobilize the body. Because of its progressively sleepy vibes, Purple Bud is a strain best enjoyed at night.Purple Bud can have several applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It may temporarily lift the troubling clouds of stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Physiologically speaking, it can numb pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. In the right setting and at the right dosage, this bud can also lull susceptible users to sleep. Because it is unlikely to induce the kind of thinking that leads to paranoia, Purple Bud is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Sensi has made seeds of Purple Bud available through several digital retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. That said, however, the strain can be tolerant of temperature changes as well as user error, thanks to its heavy dose of landrace roots. Growers looking to bring out this strain’s purple potential should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are 10 to 15 degrees below normal, just before flowering begins. Purple Bud flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield for their efforts.Purple Bud can be a luxurious and tasty nighttime treat. Its standout color and flavor also make it a novel way to spark conversation among fellow smokers.\n"

        "description": "While the only kind of purple champagne available on the spirits market may be artificially-flavored and borderline undrinkable, cannabis offers us a close approximation. Purple Champagne is a sativa-dominant strain created by famed breeder Grand Daddy Purple (aka Ken Estes) as a cross between his eponymous Grandaddy Purple and Pink Champagne. This strain offers a strong sativa kick as well as an unforgettable flavor. Its THC content has been measured at between 16% and a whopping 29%.Purple Champagne’s flowers tend to be on the smaller side, clinging together in clustered, popcorn-like formations. Despite their mostly sativa genes, they have a classically indica bud structure, with their leaves densely and solidly packed. What these buds lack in size, though, they make up for in color. The tightly-curled leaves are a patchwork of greens and purples, ranging from pale lavender to deep indigo. Anthocyanin pigments (passed on from Granddaddy Purple, which appears on both sides of this strain’s family tree) create these surprising purple hues when they’re stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, a dusting of white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these dense flowers, giving them an almost silvery sheen.Purple Champagne’s flowers emanate a tangy berry aroma that has a fermented, almost rotting odor hanging out underneath. Close inspection can also reveal a subtle grape scent. Cracking open or grinding up these tight flowers release an earthy and spicy scent, possibly passed down from grandparent strain Durban Poison. Purple Champagne’s smoke can be harsh and acrid when inhaled, but it tastes pleasantly like grapes and spices on the exhale.Like real champagne, Purple Champagne can go straight to your head. Shortly after puffing on this fruity smoke, users may feel a flush in the face as well as a mounting pressure around the eyes and temples. What follows these odd sensations is a tendency to think in cerebral terms, turning certain thoughts over and over at different angles. Some smokers may find their thoughts jumping from one to the next in free association. This focused, alert mindset can be a good way to power through a long list of work-related tasks, as well as a way to distract from the tedium of more automatic, mundane activities like doing the dishes or running errands. Initially lucid and able to carry on a conversation, those under Purple Champagne’s influence may want to put themselves in chatty social situations. After some time passes, a subtle body high creeps in, relieving tension in the muscles and helping consumers to breathe more deeply and easily. This eventual combination of mental and physical stimulation can help to enhance certain activities requiring complex coordination, like exercising and playing video games. If the dosage is increased, some users may find themselves pinned down, unwilling or unable to be active. Nevertheless, this is not the best bud to toke before heading to bed. Purple Champagne is best suited to afternoon or early evening use, when smokers can fully appreciate its decrescendo of effects.Purple Champagne’s versatility can also be of use to medical cannabis patients. It can sustain concentration on a single task for those with attention deficit disorders. It may temporarily relieve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. The strain can also soothe physical pain, ranging from chronic and disease-related pain to more common irritations like headaches and nausea. Because its sense of mindrace may be overstimulating in the wrong circumstances, Purple Champagne is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Purple Champagne for sale online. The bud can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growing plants outdoors can help to foster their typically tall heights. Purple Champagne has a long flowering time of about 9 to 10 weeks. It offers growers an average yield of flowers.As potent as it is tasty, Purple Champagne is an excellent all-purpose sativa. Its subtle body high on the backend makes it a good option for those who like to temper their mental stimulation with some physical relaxation.\n"

        "description": "Purple Candy is an indulgent indica-dominant hybrid with eye-catching flowers and a deeply therapeutic body high. This strain was created by British Columbia-based breeders BC Bud Depot -- who have also given us God Bud and Optimus Prime -- as a cross between their own Sweet Tooth and colorful Northern California favorite Mendocino Purps. As resinous as it is colorful, this bud can be a potent smoke, even for cannabis veterans. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 19%.Purple Candy distinguishes itself with large, multicolored flowers. These buds tend to be large, holding together in thick and tapered formations, almost like miniature pinecones. The squat and compact flowers have an indica-type structure, as their relatively small leaves overlap and coil tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and often also show patches of purple. These purple hues are due to the presence of pigments called anthocyanins, passed on from parent strain Mendocino Purps. Finally, these already-colorful nuggets are encrusted with cloudy white trichomes that make them very sticky and account for their high psychoactivity.When properly cured, Purple Candy’s flowers burst with a sweet berry and grape aroma. There are almost some woody base notes of pine. Grinding up the buds gives off pronounced musky and earthy odors. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Purple Candy burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. True to its name, the strain has a sugary, candy-like character with mouth-puckering fruit flavor on the exhale.Purple Candy can have a slow, creeping high, sometimes taking several minutes after users have toked to reveal its presence. A concerted pressure around the eyes and temples is one of the first signs that the strain is taking effect. There can also be some changes in the senses -- visual and auditory distortions are often reported, as is a sense of time passing more slowly. The strain’s energy may be thoughtful as first. Smokers can be decidedly introspective, putting their thoughts and problems into perspective. This cerebral high can also point itself toward any work that may be on a day’s agenda; Purple Candy’s high may be good for analytical, problem-solvings, as well as for more open-ended creative brainstorming sessions. As the high whiles itself away, the strain’s relaxing indica side reveals itself. A tingle begins to roll down from the neck and radiate outward through the core and limbs. At this point, it can be fun to kick back and get some pleasure reading done or catch up on TV shows. Purple Candy’s ever-present sativa edge may also inspire chattiness and camaraderie if the strain is consumed in social settings. You don’t need any specific plans to enjoy this potent bud, though -- just relax and let slow waves of euphoria wash over you. As dosage is increased, couchlock becomes more of a possibility, squelching any prior motivation to get up and move. Under the right conditions, it can be easy to drift off to sleep while under Purple Candy’s spell.Purple Candy’s versatile effects can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s mood-lifting properties may temporarily improve symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Its thorough body high can also numb pain, whether it’s chronic, as due to conditions like lupus and arthritis, or temporary, as due to injury. Some anti-inflammatory effects can take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. As noted, Purple Candy can also be an effective antidote to insomnia. Because it is unlikely to trigger the intense cerebral energy that comes with more sativa-dominant strains, Purple Candy can be a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Seeds of Purple Candy can be purchased from several digital retailers. The bud can be successfully grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires a warm, semi-humid climate with temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to be short and bushy, with a tendency toward strong lateral branching. Purple Candy flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors.A treat for the eyes, palate, and mind, Purple Candy is an all-around winner for fans of indica-inflected strains. If you break it out in social settings, be prepared for its fragrant smoke to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Normally, running across some purple cheese is a cause for concern and may have you running to the health department. In a cannabis dispensary, though, seeing Purple Cheese for sale is a rare treat. This indica-dominant hybrid is a combination of the diverse strains Purple #1, Blue Cheese, and Lowryder. It was created by Auto Seeds and offers a long-lasting sedative high. Purple Cheese’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 22%. Some phenotypes of the strain can also have significant levels of the therapeutic cannabinoid CBD.Although they’re eye-catching, Purple Cheese’s flowers are not particularly large. These pebbly buds tend to cling together in popcorn-like clusters. They have a tight, dense bud structure, with their spear-like leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are largely yellowish green. Frequently, though, phenotypes of Purple Cheese boast large patches of various shades of purple. These hues are the result of high concentrations of the pigment anthocyanin, likely passed on from Purple #1. Finally, a dusting of white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of Purple Cheese’s flowers, making them very difficult to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Purple Cheese give off an aroma that smells predominantly like sweet and tart grapes. On closer inspection, there’s also a tangy, cheesy aroma lurking underneath. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open these flowers give off a more earthy, musky odor. All of these clashing, pungent notes come together in an acrid smoke when Purple Cheese is burnt. This harsh smoke can a slightly sour grape flavor on the exhale. Notably, any grape flavors are incidental to this strain’s violet hues, as its coloring and aroma are determined by separate chemical compounds.Purple Cheese can come on slowly but reveals its effects in full force once it shows up. Some of its initial properties may feel notably spacey and psychedelic. Many smokers describe a concerted throbbing around the temples and forehead, as well as an increased salivation. Also common is a warping of the senses, with strong feelings of time dilation and distorted depth perception. Once acclimated to these sensations, smokers may notice that they become much more relaxed. Purple Cheese can dissipate physical tension and make users feel as if they’re melting into their immediate surroundings. For some, this pervasive relaxation can be so unfamiliar and disorienting as to cause some anxiety. In the right set and setting, though, Purple Cheese can ease smokers into a calm and reflective mindset. The strain’s effect on the senses can help to enhance atmospheric music or visually engaging movies. Its laidback, positive vibes can also be welcome in social settings, where they can encourage free-flowing conversation and camaraderie. Don’t plan on getting any crucial tasks completed while under this heavy indica’s influence, though. More cloudy and dopey than cerebral, it's a much better way to enjoy a bubble bath than to puzzle through any complex responsibilities. In high enough doses, Purple Cheese can even lull smokers into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its mostly slowly-moving effects, this is a strain best reserved for nighttime use.Purple Cheese’s pleasant sedation can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its ability to quiet mental chatter can have a temporary positive effect on cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. It may also numb physical pain, ranging from the chronic and disease-related to the minor and temporary. Finally, as noted, Purple Cheese can provide relief for stubborn insomniacs.Fortunately for home growers, Auto Seeds has made seeds of Purple Cheese available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to grow short and bushy; growers should “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that can block light and air from nourishing low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to bring out this bud’s purple vibrancy should briefly expose their plants to cold (but not freezing) nighttime temperatures. Purple Cheese flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.Don’t let its odd name put you off -- Purple Cheese is a potent strain that’s a must try for indica lovers. If you’re worried about discretion, though, be warned that this can be a particularly pungent smoke.\n"

        "description": "Earthquake is a sativa-dominant hybrid with strong, long-lasting effects. Little is known about this mysterious strain’s breeders or lineage, but its well-balanced appeal to consumers is clear. Earthquake also packs an aromatic punch, with flavors of pine and diesel. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 17% and 23%.Earthquake impresses right away with large, chunky flowers that adhere in elongated, almost cylindrical shapes. These buds have a solidly indica structure, with leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. The actual leaves are a mottled mix of shades of dark and light green and are twisted through with curly, rust-colored pistils. Finally, a blanket of translucent white trichomes cover the buds’ inner and outer nooks and crannies and account for their psychoactivity.When properly cured, flowers of Earthquake give off the fresh, pleasant scent of pine needles. Hanging out underneath is an earthy smell of dried wood and soil. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open these nuggets gives off a faint chemical scent, suggesting possible descent from sativa favorite Chemdawg. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Earthquake gives off a harsh and acrid smoke that can sting the palate and sinuses. On the exhale, this thick smoke carries a piney, diesel-like taste.Earthquake’s high can be a creeper, taking a long time before striking smokers with its potency. At first, Earthquake’s action can be detected in the form of a flushing in the cheeks or a tingle around the temples and eyes. Once they adjust to these odd sensations, consumers may feel themselves relax into an elevated mode of thinking. Ideas and concepts that might not be otherwise interesting can grab the user’s fascination. This cerebral mindset can be great for accomplishing analytical, task-based work. It can also be great for inducing chattiness and fostering easy camaraderie in social situations. In the right set and setting, this strain can also lift the user’s typical inhibitions, allowing for free and easy brainstorming or inspiring work on open-ended creative projects. As the high progresses or as dosage is increased, Earthquake’s indica side begins to take over, sending a warm tingle down the spine and outward through the core and limbs. Although not completely paralyzing, this body high can be enough to make consumers seek out the closest comfortable couch. In these later stages, the strain can be a good way to kick back with like-minded friends after a long day or week of work to share some food or to begin a binge-watching session. Because of its gradual taper down from buzzy mental energy to physical relaxation, Earthquake is recommended for enjoyment between afternoon and evening.Earthquake’s buzzy, upbeat effects can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The lucid focus associated with its onset can help those with attention deficit disorders to maintain focus on a single task. The strain’s mood-boosting properties can also help to temporarily alleviate some symptoms associated with stress and depression. For some, Earthquake may dull physical pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe minor irritations like headaches. Because it may bring about intense patterns of recursive thinking, Earthquake is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic, paranoia or anxiety.Seeds of Earthquake are not available for sale online. As such, growers must obtain clippings from mature plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” Earthquake may be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls from a humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers should regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any large fan leaves that could prevent light and air from nourishing any low-growing flowering nodes.Earthquake’s versatility makes it a great option for indica and sativa lovers alike. The strain can be a particularly fun way to enhance a trip to the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "With a hybrid variability that changes depending on growing techniques, Afghan Haze is a strain that’s revered in the medical community. The brainchild of former Sensi breeder Nevil Schoenmaker and Mr. Nice Seed’s Shantibaba, it’s created by crossing Afghan and Haze. In most cases, it’s found as a 60/40 sativa-dominant strain and is great for more experienced smokers.Afghan Haze brings a hefty amount of THC to the table, with batches testing as high as 21%. A potent smell permeates each nug, with a pleasant earthy and nutty tone that transitions to a more skunky scent while smoking. Its flavor is somewhat similar, coming off a bit sweeter and reminding some of the flavor of tea. Buds of Afghan Haze are quite dense with a spattering of red tones, bright pistils, and packed on amber toned trichomes.This strain is one that might be better for nighttime use, although some prefer it during the day for its mind clearing properties. The high from Afghan Haze will leave you feeling focused and entirely functional without a trace of worry, anxiety, or paranoia. Soon after, your body will start to feel relaxed and in many cases quite sleepy. During this sedating time, you might end up with a case of the giggles, proving this to be a good choice for social activities that don’t require much energy.Patients who use marijuana for medicinal purposes might pick Afghan Haze as their number one strain because of how calming it is throughout the entire body. Any sense of headaches, body pain, or stress will be wiped away with almost a moment’s notice, and you’ll be left with a sense of peace and tranquility. Individuals who struggle with their appetite can find relief with Afghan Haze, and it can be a great choice before bed as well.Cultivating Afghan Haze is a true test of one’s patience, as it takes 10 weeks of indoor grow time before flowering begins. However, with a little extra attention and TLC, this strain will give you immense amounts of frosty flowers if you’re able to wait long enough. A lot of lighting and water gives this girl everything she needs to thrive.Whether you’re on the hunt for a recreational high or you need something to take the edge off of pain or depression, Afghan Haze will do the job right.

        "description": "Offering users a strong citrus flavor with a buzzing high that gets you going, Agent Tangie is crafted by growers at 3C Farms. Coming from parents Agent Orange and Tangie, it’s a strain that’s not well-known yet brings an interesting set of effects to the table. Many compare it to drinking a cup of coffee in the morning due to its energizing properties.While there are sure to be some outliers in the mix, Agent Tangie comes in with a pretty consistent THC level that ranges between 16% and 18%. It’s a strain that’s rather subdued with light colored nugs complete with decent amounts of trichomes and resin, yet brings a delicious smell to your nose instantly. Hints of orange, lemon, and a spicy zest all combine for an experience that tastes just as nice as its aroma.This strain’s scent gives users a bit of a clue when it comes to the kind of high that’s incoming, as a rather zesty, uplifted, and happy sensation overwhelms your head and slowly moves to the rest of your body. Best for those who need focus, it can come in handy when a looming deadline is near or if you’re in the mood to cross some things off your to-do list. Keep in mind that Agent Tangie will induce a case of the giggles that can get more and more intense, so if you’re prone to anxiety you may want to skip this strain.Above all else, this strain is great for medical patients who struggle with depression and stress. Some might consider it to be the ultimate mood booster as it improves your mental state while allowing you to be quite functional. Others who suffer from fatigue also appreciate the burst of energy that comes from this high.Agent Tangie must be a well-kept secret within the growing community because best practices for cultivating this strain are nowhere to be found. As with most plants, pay close attention to how it behaves in both outdoor and indoor environments, and more than likely it will be tough to mess this one up.A well-balanced high that can bring relaxation to sore muscles, ease worries of the mind, and give you the focus needed to complete difficult tasks, Agent Tangie is a miracle worker. If you enjoy citrus flavors this will probably be your go-to daytime strain.\n"

        "description": "As if the ubiquitous Blue Dream couldn’t get any better, this derivative strain takes that hybrid’s genetics to the next level. Super Blue Dream is a cross between tasty favorite Blue Dream and the highly resinous Super Silver Haze. The result has all the bag appeal of its blue parent strain with an added sativa energy. Its well-balanced high is enjoyable in a wide variety of situations. Super Blue Dream’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 21%.Flowers of Super Blue Dream are typically small to medium in size and adhere in tight, popcorn-like clusters. These buds betray their indica influence with small leaves curled tightly inward in a compact, densely-packed structure. These leaves themselves are a vibrant yellowish green. Sometimes, however, phenotypes of Super Blue Dream express bright purple hues in their leaves; this anomaly is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which can release shades of blue and purple when stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Finally, translucent amber-colored trichomes give these already-colorful flowers an almost golden hue.When they’re properly cured, the aroma of sweet and tart blueberries springs up from these buds. On closer inspection, there’s also a light herbal quality, somewhat like dried plant matter, possibly passed on from grandparent strain Haze. Grindin up the tight nuggets releases a sweeter, more earthy odor of musk. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Super Blue Dream burns with a smooth and pleasant smoke. This smoke has berry and citrus flavors with a touch of musk on the exhale.Super Blue Dream hits quickly, making itself known even before consumers have finished exhaling its tasty smoke. The first physical symptoms can manifest as small tics, like a rush of blood to the face and a tingle around the eyes and temples. Following these sensations, effects are marked by a stimulation of analytical thinking. Smokers may find their thoughts jumping from one to the net in rapid succession or with a newfound intensity. Such a mindset can be a good way to accomplish a long list of work-related tasks or even freeform creative projects. Eventually, this strain's potent physical high sets in, undoing any persistent physical tension and weighing down limbs and eyelids in equal measure. If they’re not already sitting, smokers may make a beeline for the closest comfortable couch. For a while, Super Blue Dream’s mental clarity persists, making it a good way to enjoy activities that involve both mental and physical coordination, like exercise and video games. As the high wears on, however, -- or as dosage is increased -- Super Blue Dream can have a dreamy, hazy quality, pinning consumers in place and making their thoughts more cloudy than analytical. On its backend, Super Blue Dream is a great strain to enjoy with some like-minded friends after a long day or week of work. Because of its balanced effects and gradual taper down into relaxation, this strain is best enjoyed during the late afternoon through early evening.Super Blue Dream can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its lucidity can encourage focus on a single task for those with attention deficit disorders. Its upbeat, mood-altering properties may also temporarily relieve the harsh symptoms of mild to moderate stress, depression, and anxiety. Physiologically speaking, the strain’s body high can numb aches and pains, from the chronic and disease-related to simple, everyday irritations like headaches. Patients who are prone to panic or paranoia should consumer Super Blue Dream with caution, as its sativa effects can become overwhelming in the wrong set and setting.With no large breeders producing seeds of Super Blue Dream on a commercial scale, prospective growers must obtain clippings of the strain from a trusted source in order to grow clones. This strain can be fostered indoors or out, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branches. Those looking to bring out Super Blue Dream’s purple hues should briefly expose their crops to nighttime temperatures at least 10 to 15 degrees below average. Once mature, these plants produce an average yield of flowers.Bring out Super Blue Dream as a way to one-up fellow consumers who have only ever enjoyed its more common predecessor. This hybrid is enjoyable for both solo and boisterous social use.\n"

        "description": "Super Cheese is an indica-dominant hybrid with a legacy that follows in the tradition of Dutch cannabis breeding. This pungent strain was created by Positronics, breeders of strains like Blue Rhino and Critical 47, and crosses the genetics of staple strain Cheese with the distinct phenotype Exodus Cheese. What results is a skunky, acrid bud with a holistic, well-balanced high. Super Cheese’s Thc content has been measured at between 15% and 25%.Super Cheese is marked by medium-sized, solid flowers that hold an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. These buds have the dense structure associated with other indica-dominant varieties, with leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Frequently, phenotypes of Super Cheese also boast patches of purple in their leaves; these surprising hues come about when high concentrations of the pigment anthocyanin are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover the buds’ complex network of nooks and crannies, accounting for the strain’s potency and making it very hard to break up by hand.There’s no mistaking the lineage of this aptly-named strain. A quick inspection reveals the strong, tangy odor of sharp cheese. A closer sniff hints as some fermented, almost moldy notes, making the aroma similar to that of cousin strain Blue Cheese. Grinding up Super Cheese’s dense buds gives off some dank, musky scents. When this pungent strain is combusted in a pipe or a joint, it burns with a harsh and stinky smoke that may tickle the palate or make the eyes water. On the exhale, this smoke leaves behind a lingering taste of cheese, along with some skunky fumes.Super Cheese’s high doesn't appear until some time after smokers have recovered from their distaste or coughing fits. The first observable effects may be an increased pulse behind the eyes and around the temples; many also report an increase in salivation. These physical tics soon progress into a full body high. Smokers may feel their limbs and eyelids grow more and more weighty while at the same time, a ringle rolls down through the body, dissipating muscular tension and facilitating deep and easy breathing. For the uninitiated, this body high can be so strong as to trigger feelings of dissociation or depersonalization. Such trippy effects are often intensified by Super Cheese’s changes in sensory perception -- certain sights and sounds may take on new dimensions, while depth perception can be notably distorted. Super Cheese comes with only a subtle head high, more characterized by a tendency to think in freely-associative patterns than by any uptick in rational, intensely cerebral thinking. Instead, enjoy this bud as a good way to have some giddy, rowdy conversations with like-minded friends. Alternatively, smoke Super Cheese before kicking back for some much-needed solo time. Because it is more sedative than mentally stimulating, this strain is best reserved for nighttime use; if consumed during the day, it’s likely to derail an agenda or any outstanding responsibilities.Super Cheese can also have many benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its smooth, soothing attitude may temporarily relieve some symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Meanwhile, its action on the body can numb pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related, or more minor, like headaches and nausea. For some, Super Cheese can stoke hunger, making it a good supplement for those who have lost their appetite to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Finally, in high enough doses, this potent strain can work against insomnia, pulling users into a deep, restful sleep. Because it is unlikely to trigger the kind of recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia. Super Cheese is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Positronics have made seeds of Super Cheese available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants have a short and bushy silhouette and are easily accommodated indoors. Super Cheese flowers within a brief 7 to 8 weeks and offers a solid yield of about 32 to 37 grams (1.1 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Finally, indoors growers should be sure to keep their operations discreet by investing in odor control measures, as Super Cheese can be an extremely pungent crop.Super Cheese’s long-lasting potency proves that sometimes a so-called acquired taste is worth acquiring. This bud is a must-try for fans of knockout indicas.\n"

        "description": "Super Jack is a potent sativa-leaning hybrid that amplifies the outstanding effects of its two parents strains. This energetic bud is the product of legendary sativa Jack Herer and highly resinous Super Silver Haze. Created by Amsterdam-based Southseeds, Super Jack delivers long-lasting energy and mental clarity for a variety of daytime activities and moods. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 24%.Super Jack can be identified by its large flowers which ahdere in spadelike forms, tapering from a broad base down into a pointed tip. Despite this strain’s sativa lineage, its buds have a characteristically indica structure, with leaves curled tightly inward rather than spiraling loosely out from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and are offset by twisted orange pistils. A blanket of resinous trichomes leaves these flowers very sticky and difficult to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of Super Jack smell earthy and dank, reminiscent of wet soil. Hanging underneath this aroma is a bright citrus scent, similar to fresh orange zest. Meanwhile, grinding up Super Jack’s buds releases some herbal notes of sage and eucalyptus. When burnt, the strain gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes both fruity and hashy on the exhale.Super Jack takes hold quickly, exerting a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples. It may also cause the face to flush, especially if the consumer stands up after toking. Almost immediately thereafter, Super Jack’s cerebral quality begins to shine through with all the inspiration and clearheaded focus that makes Jack Herer so popular. USers may find their ideas swirling around in free association or may begin to turn over particularly interesting concepts, searching for solutions to an entrenched question or problem. As such, Super Jack can be a great accompaniment to a busy workload, whether you’re focused on complex professional tasks or simply running through mundane chores. As the high wears on, a mild body high creeps in to provide a tingle of relaxation and pervasive relief in the core and limbs. These physical effects are unlikely to slow down or incapacitate users, though, instead serving to lift any lingering anxiety. Super Jack’s ideal combination of mental and physical stimulation can be particularly good for engaging in activities that involve mental and physical coordination -- including, but not limited to, exercise, dancing, and even sex. For those in a less active mood, Super Jack can be a great way to break the ice in social situations, sparking conversation and easy camaraderie. Because of its mostly energetic properties, Super Jack is best enjoyed as a daytime treat; consumed before bed, it’s almost certain to keep sleepy smokers awake and wired.Super Jack’s versatility also makes it useful for medical cannabis patients. Its long-lasting sense of focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on single tasks. This strain may also help those suffering from mild to moderate stress or depression to spend their time more consciously and deliberately. Super Jack’s physical properties can soothe aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. It may also take the sting out of everyday annoyances like headaches and nausea. Those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume Super Jack with caution, as its early cerebral effects can take on an unnerving feeling of “mindrace.”Fortunately for home growers, Southseeds has made seeds of Super Jack for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. The indica-typical plants grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers should be sure to trim away any broad fan leaves that can prevent light and nutrients from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Super Jack has a brief flowering time for a sativa of about 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors. It offers growers a yield of about 37 to 46 grams (or 1.3 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Super Jack’s mellow vibes are excellent for introspection, as well as for a boisterous day shared with friends. Its energy and lucidity can be especially fun on an adventure through the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "Suzy Q is a CBD-rich strain with potent therapeutic effects. It was created by Burning Bush Nurseries, a prolific group of breeders that supplies flowers of strains like Key Lime Pie to California dispensaries. While Suzy Q’s genetics are kept proprietary by Burning Bush, there’s no denying this strain’s power to numb both physical pain and psychological stress. While this bud’s THC content is typically low, at around 1%, its CBD content has been measured at as high as 25%.Once trimmed, Suzy Q’s flowers are small to medium in size. They are roughly spadelike in shape, tapering from a wide base to a pointed tip. The buds appear to be more sativa than indica in structure, with long leaves that spiral out loosely from their central stems and can be easily torn away. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of olive green and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Because Suzy Q is so low in THC, its ragged leaves have relatively few trichomes, making it fairly easy to break apart its buds by hand.Suzy Q has a rich and woodsy aromatic profile. The most prominent scent wafting up from these dense flowers is that of fresh pine. This familiar smell is undercut by a more dank, earthy musk, redolent of damp soil. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart Suzy Q’s flowers gives off some hash and spice, perhaps providing evidence of OG Kush or Afghani in the bud’s lineage. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Suzy Q offers a thick, rich smoke that can be acrid and harsh on the lungs, triggering coughing. On the exhale, this smoke carries the strong tastes of pine, mixed with some sourness and spice.Because of its high ratio of CBD to the more psychoactive THC, Suzy Q comes with few real psychedelic properties. That said, its power of relaxation can be so thorough as to compare to the trippy effects of more traditional, THC-rich indicas. Several minutes after consuming Suzy Q, smokers may detect a concerted pressure behind the eyes or around the temples. This odd sensation is often accompanied by a kind of tingle trickling down the neck and outward through the core and limbs. The resulting relaxation can be so strong as to lay smokers out flat, relieving them of muscular aches and tensions. While Suzy Q comes with few conventionally cerebral effects, its power to calm the body and mind may have the effects of helping consumers to think more clearly or imaginatively, free of typical everyday inhibitions. With none of the telltale signs of cannabis intoxication, Suzy Q is an excellent option for those who can’t or would prefer not to be hamstrung by a psychoactive high. Because it leaves the user with a lucid train of thought, neither overly sedative nor overly stimulating, Suzy Q is appropriate for use at any time of day.Thanks to its sky-high quantities of CBD, Suzy Q may be more valuable to medical cannabis patients than to recreational users. Most notably, it has the power to numb pain, acting as an analgesic for deep-seated symptoms related to chronic conditions like lupus or arthritis. It can also take care of lesser afflictions, like injury-related pain and soreness and irritations like headaches and indigestion. Psychologically speaking, these soothing properties may also subtract the harsh, often psychosomatic symptoms of certain cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Because it is not at all likely to bring about the kind of “mindrace” that can lead to frantic, paranoid thinking in the wrong conditions, Suzy Q is an optimal strain for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC. As noted, it can also be an excellent medication for people -- like children -- who should not be exposed to any psychoactive properties.Burnish Bush has made seeds of Suzy Q available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The strain’s plants can be somewhat tall and may need to be trimmed back early on in order to fit in limited indoor grow spaces. Suzy Q flowers within 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors.Suzy Q joints the growing legion of high-CBD strains that set a new standard in over-the-counter,  all-purpose wellness. Somewhat difficult to come by, this strain is worth snatching up for its holistic, therapeutic effects.\n"

        "description": "Sweet Black Angel is a heavenly strain with roots on opposite ends of the cannabis breeding spectrum. Created by Samsara Seeds (who have also given us Green Love Potion and Ultraviolet), this bud is a cross between resinous sativa Super Silver Haze and dark-leafed indica Black Domina. Named for a Rolling Stones song about civil rights activist Angela Davis, Sweet Black Angel offers a fruity flavor profile and a pervasive body high that’s sure to appeal to cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. Its THC content has been measured at between a moderate 15% to 18%.Flowers of Sweet Black Angel are usually underwhelmingly small to medium in size. They have a roughly globular shape and can often be pointed at the ends. In following with their mostly indica lineage, these buds have a compact structure, with their small leaves overlapping and curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a deep olive green and are twisted through with curly brown and orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants.Sweet Black Angel has a predominantly sweet and sour aroma, somewhat like spoiled milk. On closer inspection, there’s also a hint of pine that brightens up the overall impression. Meanwhile, grinding up these dense buds releases a herbal, vegetal scent, possibly passed on from the Haze in the strain’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Sweet Black Angel burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that can easily trigger coughing. On the exhale, this smoke carries a berry flavor, accented by some pine.Sweet Black Angel offers a slow creeping, high that may take several minutes before revealing itself to the user. Initial effects can be detected as a faint pressure around the eyes and temples and a flushing in the cheeks. Some smokers may also be hit by a feeling of sensory distortion that can disrupt their perceptions of depth as well as the passage of time. These sensations can amplified by playing trippy music or films for some atmospheric background noise. What little mental stimulation this bud offers comes in the form of easy, giggly amusement and a cloudy sort of daydreaming. Rather than puzzling through complex, analytical tasks, use Sweet Black Angel as way to kick back after a long day with some like-minded friends. As time passes or as dosage is increased, this bud’s physical sedation can become even more pronounced. Consumers may have difficulty in getting up from the couch -- and even if they can manage to stand, any subsequent physical activity may make them feel as if they’re wading through peanut butter. In the right setting, Sweet Black Angel can be strong enough to pull susceptible users into a deep, restful sleep.Sweet Black Angel can also have several uses for medical cannabis patients. Its generally easygoing, even-tempered high may temporarily take the edge off of the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Meanwhile, its physical-leaning properties can be used to dull pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or just minor, as in cases of headaches or nausea. As noted, Sweet Black Angel can even help those who suffer from insomnia. Because it is unlikely to lead consumers down a path of introspection and paranoia, this strain is a good option for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Sweet Black Angel are available for sale online. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Like many indicas, these plants have a typically squat and bushy silhouette and may need to be pruned occasionally in order to encourage the flowering of any low-growing nodes. Sweet Black Angel flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in early October when grown outdoors. It offers growers a yield of about 46 grams (or 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Sweet Black Angel is a luxurious indica with a rich, fruity aroma to complement its sleepy, zoned-out effects. It’s as relaxing as -- and can sometimes be a nice accompaniment to - a hot bubble bath.\n"

        "description": "Tangerine Haze is a delicious sativa-dominant hybrid with buzzy, thoughtful effects. Originally bred in the Netherlands, this tasty bud was conceived of as a cross between G13 Haze and regional favorite NYC Diesel. What results is a strain with a complex citrus flavor and the kind of high-flying effects that fans of the Haze family have come to appreciate. Its THC content has been measured at between 11% and 21%.Tangerine Haze tends to have medium-sized flowers that hold a spadelike formation, almost like miniature pinecones. The structure of these buds, however, tends to vary by phenotype, with some appearing compact and dense and others fluffier, with more ragged leaves. In all cases, the leaves themselves are a dark, mossy green and threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Finally, a dusting of crystalline trichomes gives these flowers a silvery sheen and a very resinous texture.When properly cured, the most prominent scent that Tangerine Haze’s flowers carry is a tangy citrus odor. Hanging out underneath is a sweet, almost cloying character reminiscent of cotton candy. Meanwhile, grinding up or pulling apart these flowers reveals their Haze lineage, with prominent herbal and vegetal notes. When burnt, Tangerine Haze gives off a very smooth and fruity that tastes vaguely spicy on the exhale.Like many other strong sativas, Tangerine Haze hits quickly. Smokers may be struck by a sudden increase in cerebral activity, with certain thoughts and concepts occupying more brainspace than they ordinarily might. Many also report cognitive distortions in navigating space and time; depth perception can be altered and a powerful sense of time dilation may set in. Once adjusted to this new mindset, though, smokers find that they are endowed with the energy needed to accomplish a day’s worth of responsibilities, ranging from analytical, work-related tasks to mundane chores.Fortunately, Tangerine Haze’s sense of focus persists for the duration of the high, maximizing the strain’s payoff. As time passes, a subtle physical high can creep in, relieving muscular tension and calming down any minds that may have become overly active. This strain is unlikely to weigh users down with couchlock, unless dosage is drastically increased. In fact, Tangerine Haze’s ideal combination of mental and physical stimulation make it a good all-purpose enhancement for activities that involve full body and brain coordination, like exercising and playing video games. Because of its active, productive vibes, this is one strain that’s daytime-appropriate. It can be an excellent wake-and-bake contribution to your breakfast spread.Tangerine Haze’s buzzy properties can also have many benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its mental clarity and lucidity can sustain focus for those with attention deficit disorders. It can also help those with mild to moderate cases of stress and depression to live in the moment and spend their time more consciously and intentionally. Physiologically speaking, Tangerine Haze may numb mild everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Because it can induce hyperactive, recursive patterns of thinking, this strains is not recommended for those who are prone to paranoia and panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.While some digital retailers purport to sell seeds of this storied strain, consumers should always investigate a source’s reputation and rating. Alternatively, home growers can obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of Tangerine Haze in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” The strain can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its sativa roots suggest that Tangerine Haze can grow very tall when flowering; indoor growers may want to keep their crop’s’ height in check by pruning plants back early in the vegetative stage. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.Tangerine Haze is both and all-purpose and all-day strain that’s sure to impress cannabis veterans and newcomers alike.

        "description": "Tangerine Kush is a mostly indica variety that offers a dreamy, relaxing high. This strain gets its bold citrus flavor from sativa hybrid Tangerine Haze and its stoney effects from breeder Rare Dankness’ flagship indica Rare Darkness. With a healthy dose of sativa effects as well, this strain is a great choice for indica fans who’d like to maintain some measure of energy and productivity. Its THC content has been measured at between 14% and 20%.Tangerine Kush sets itself apart with exceptionally large flowers. These buds usually have tapered shape, narrowing down from a broad base into a pointed tip, like mini Christmas trees. The leaves cling together, overlapping as they spiral inward toward their central stems in an indica-typical bud structure. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and are set off by curly orange and brown hairs -- which are actually pistils, botanical structure meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Cloudy white trichomes top off these already-colorful buds and account for their very sticky texture.If Tangerine Kush is notable for anything, it’s the show-stopping flavor and aroma. Floating on top is an unmistakable, mouth-puckering orange flavor. There’s also a sweet and sugary undertone. Meanwhile, grinding up these large buds yield some earthy, hash notes, evidence of the strain’s Kush backbone. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Tangerine Kush burns with a sweet and easily palatable smoke. This smoke has a tropical citrus flavor on the exhale with an herbal aftertaste.Tangerine Kush hits quickly for an indica -- shortly after savoring the strain’s citrus-tinged smoke, consumers may feel some cerebral stimulation. Thoughts may flow in a loud, freely-associative inner monologue and may temporarily cause smokers to tune out from their immediate surroundings. Some physical effects may be present as well, like a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples and, sometimes, an increase in salivation. Some may find that they’re creatively inspired or compelled to take on complex, analytical tasks. Within a short time, however, this mental energy slips into a more mellow and soothing body high. Users may find that they’re able to breathe more deeply and easily and may notice that any lingering muscular tension is somewhat relieved. At this point, any previously cerebral mindset begins to take a backseat to a more pleasantly cloudy and distracted headspace. As smokers being to melt into their surroundings and feel the outside world recede into the background, they may want to immerse themselves in a purely sensory atmosphere. Moody music or visually-engaging movies may help to set the right tone for enjoying Tangerine Kush’s spacey, psychedelic high. Unfortunately, this strain’s effects are said to last shorter than average. Because of its sedative character, Tangerine kush is best reserved for evening or nighttime use.Tangerine Kush’s versatile properties can also have value for medical cannabis patients. Its early sativa focus can briefly aid concentration for those with attention deficit disorder. Its mood-altering effects also temporarily take the edge off of stress and depression. More frequently, Tangerine Kush’s body high can serve as an analgesic for aches and pains, whether they’re the result of chronic illness or simply due to everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or anxiety may want to consume this strain with caution, as its early “mindrace” effects can lead to paranoia in the wrong circumstances.Rare Dankness has made seeds of Tangerine Kush available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy and growers may need to trim away any broad fan leaves that can prevent light and air from penetrating through the dense layer and reaching any low-growing nodes. Tangerine Kush flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers an average yield of flowers.Tangerine Kush’s mellow, easygoing energy can be a great way to connect with friends or simply to claim some alone time. Regardless of your company, though, it’s an excellent and fragrant way to kick back after a long day or week.\n"

        "description": "Nowhere near as sinister or intimidating as its fictional namesake, Walter White is a potent sativa-dominant hybrid. Created by the UK-based Mephisto Genetics, Walter White is an attempt to improve on the high resin production of The White by crossing it with an unspecified sativa. What results is a tasty bud with buzzy, heady effects. Its THC levels have been measured at between 15% and 21%.Walter White is marked by large, chunky flowers that have surprisingly irregular forms. These exceptional buds look more like fluffy clouds than like any of the more conventional botanical shapes like spheres or spades. The seafoam green leaves are clustered densely together and are twisted through with hairy, dark brown pistils. True to their name, Walter White’s buds are also coated in an exceptionally high volume of translucent white trichomes, making their leaves appear very pale from a distance.When properly cured, Walter White’s flowers carry a dank, earthy scent. On closer inspection, there are also some zesty hints of citrus. Meanwhile, grinding up the amorphous buds releases the fragrance of fresh pine. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Walter White gives off a thick, acrid smoke that may tickle the palate and sinuses. This smoke tastes like a combination of pine and citrus on the exhale and finishes with a creamy mouthfeel. Smokers who’d like to maintain discretion should beware that this bud can be a very pungent smoke; some odor control precautions may be required.Like many other strong sativas, Walter White hits quickly, exerting a pressure around the eyes and temples. Many smokers also note a flushing in their cheeks and an increase in salivation. Within short order, though, these odd sensations morph into an upbeat and active mental stimulation. Thoughts may flow in a freely-associative monologue and may occupy more of the consumer's attention than they otherwise might. Such unyielding focus makes this strain a good way to accomplish a mountain of work, whether you’re executing complex analytical tasks or simply running some errands. Walter White can also lift mental inhibitions, thereby facilitating creativity for any freewheeling, open-ended projects. Luckily, this bud’s stimulation tends to be more grounded and calm than that of many other sativas, allowing users to carry on lucid conversations and move about their daily agendas as usual. Walter White may be especially welcome in social situations, where it can break the ice, sparking conversations and camaraderie among like-minded companions. While the high’s latter half comes with a subtle physical relaxation, this body high is not nearly strong enough to couchlock smokers or to derail their built-up motivation. As such, Walter White is best enjoyed as a wake-and-bake treat or an afternoon pick-me-up. If consumed before bed, it’s likely to keep smokers wide awake.Walter White can also have many applications for medical cannabis patients. It may help sustain focus and concentrations for those with attention deficit disorders. Its buzzy properties can also temporarily take the edge off of the gloom of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, the strain may also stoke hunger, making it an effective appetite suppressant for those who struggle with appetite. Some relief from mild irritations like headaches and nausea is possible as well. Because its cerebral onset can be very intense and disorienting in the wrong circumstances, Walter White is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Fortunately for home growers, Mephisto has made seeds of Walter White available for sale online. It can be successfully cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for as semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants of the strain tend to be short and bushy, rarely exceeding 3 feet in height. Walter White flowers within a long 10 to 11 weeks when grown outdoors. Once flowering begins, growers may need to support the blooming colas with wooden stakes to keep the overburdened branches from drooping too much.Strong and long-lasting, Walter White is a strain sure to impress even experienced and jaded sativa fans. Its high resin output can also be very valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "No longer just an old-timey synonym for booze, The Sauce is a sativa-dominant that offers complex flavors and a versatile high. Created by prolific breeders Exotic Genetix -- who have also given us Kimbo Kush and Cookies and Cream -- The Sauce is a cross between hybrid Green Ribbon and potent indica Gorilla Glue #4. With an earthy, multi-layered flavor, it’s no wonder that this bud was named Best Flower in the 2015 Dope Cup in Seattle. Its THC has been measured at between 15% and an impressive 28%.In contrast to their standout flavor, The Sauce’s flowers can be somewhat visually underwhelming. The buds are small to medium in size and cling together in pebbly, popcorn-like formations. These flowers have an indica-typical structure, with their small leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are threaded through with curly, pale yellow pistils. Finally, a thorough coating of translucent amber trichomes accounts for this strain’s psychoactivity and makes the flowers very hard to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, flowers of The Sauce burst with the rich, earthy scent of cocoa. Hanging out underneath is a pronounced sweet and sour tang. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the flowers releases some fumes that are redolent of gasoline and skunk. When they’re burnt, these buds burns with a thick and acrid smoke that can often induce coughing and watery eyes. On the exhale, this rich smoke has a tropical citrus flavor mixed with some fruity notes of skunk.The Sauce takes hold relatively quickly. Before they’ve even finished coughing, smokers may notice a distinct head rush, marked by a flush in the cheeks and sometimes by an increase in salivation. Some sensory amplification may be present as well -- sights and sounds can take on a new intensity, with some pseudo hallucinations taking place in the periphery or smokers’ vision. As they acclimate to these sensations, though, consumers may be endowed with a clear and uplifting mental energy that can unlock new avenues of thinking. The Sauce can serve as an enhancement for complex, task-based work as well as more open ended creative projects. Despite this mental stimulation, The Sauce allows consumers to maintain a solid footing in the real world, able to carry out their responsibilities and to lucidly follow along with conversations. Indeed, this strain can be a particularly good way to spice up social gatherings, sparking conversations and camaraderie among friends and new acquaintances alike. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, the strain’s body high becomes somewhat pronounced. Waves of relaxation may roll through the core and taper down to the extremities, untying any knots of tension in the muscles and helping users to breathe more freely and easily. In this newly relaxed state, The Sauce’s liberated mental energy can be enhanced by some moody lighting and atmospheric music. If sufficiently motivated, smokers may also want to engage in activities that require both physical and mental focus -- including dancing, playing video games, and -- in the right set and setting -- sex. In most cases, this strains’ relaxation is not heavy enough to pin users in their seats. As such, this strain is best enjoyed during the afternoon or early evening; if consumed at night, it’s likely to keep sleepy smokers awake and wired.The Sauce may have several users for medical cannabis patients as well. Its long-lasting focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain concentration on a single task. Its clearheaded, positive vibes can also soothe the difficult symptoms of certain cases of stress and depression. Physical benefits include relief from pain, whether it’s deep-seated and chronic, or temporary and injury-related. This bud may also provoke hunger, serving as an appetite stimulant for patients who have lost their appetites to disease or treatments like chemotherapy. Because of its strong patterns of intense, recursive thinking, The Sauce is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of The Sauce are available from several digital retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. The plants tend to be bushy and branchy and of average height. The Sauce flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a high yield of flowers for their efforts.The Sauce’s plentiful flavors are a good conversation starter in rowdy party settings. Its well-balanced effects are a good way to appreciate a trip through the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "Tangerine Power is an aromatic, sativa-dominant hybrid that proves that taste doesn’t have to come at the expense of potency in cannabis breeding. Created by Las Vegas-based Sin City Seeds, the purveyors of Happy Nightmare and White Moonshine, this strain is a cross between fragrant Agent Orange and Sin City’s own indica Blue Power. The resulting bud gives smokers a smooth transition from mental acuity to deep physical relaxation. The strain’s psychoactivity and taste even earned it 1st Place in the NorCal Secret Cup. Its THC has been measured at between 15% and 25%.Tangerine Power is marked by medium to large flowers that hold a roughly spherical formation, although some phenotypes may be more tapered at either end. Much like parent strain Blue Power, these buds have a tight and compact indica-type structure. The leaves are a dark shade of forest green and are threaded through with burnt orange to brown-colored pistils. Finally, a glittering coat of trichomes covers these thick buds and makes them difficult to break up without a quality grinder.As one might expect, the dominant aroma of this strain has strong notes of orange. The flowers also carry a strong, candy-like sweetness. Grinding up the tight buds releases some dank, earthy notes. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Tangerine Power burns with a smooth and easily ingested smoke. This smoke tastes both herbal and citrusy on the exhale, leaving behind the overall impression of strongly-flavored tea.Tangerine Power strikes the user quickly, exerting a sativa influence on the head. As the same time as they detect a flush in the cheeks or a slight throbbing around the temples, smokers may feel a sharpening of their mental energy. They may be more likely to focus intently on certain topics or thoughts, and to jump from one idea to the next in free association. Fortunately, this cerebral energy is tempered by a growing relaxation that gradually trickles down from the neck and spreads through the core and limbs. Users may find that they’re particularly at ease in social situations, able to freely and lucidly converse with like-minded friends. Tangerine Power can also help bring a newfound clarity to analytic, problem-solving scenarios and may make mundane chores like cleaning the house much more enjoyable. As time passes, this strain’s physical effects become more and more pronounced. Smokers may feel their limbs and eyelids weighed down in equal measure and consequently may begin to seek out the closest comfortable surroundings. In these later stages, cerebral focus gives way to a pleasantly hazy mindset that’s perfect for lazing out and starting binge-watching session. If sufficiently tired, consumers may find themselves lulled to sleep by Tangerine Power’s strong sedative properties. Because of its taper down from energy to relaxation, this strain is best enjoyed between late afternoon and early evening.Tangerine Power can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its lasting focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders. Its ever-present positive energy can also temporarily alleviate the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. On the physical side, the strain’s relaxing effects may soothe deep-seated aches and pains, whether they’re due to injury or to chronic conditions like lupus and fibromyalgia. Because its onset is associated with a palpable feeling of “mindrace,” those who are prone to panic should consume Tangerine Power in moderation and with caution.Sin City has made seeds of Tangerine Power available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Only moderately tall, the strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a below average yield of about 28 to 37 grams (or 1 to 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.As enjoyable when savored alone as it is shared with friends, Tangerine Power is an excellent accompaniment to many everyday activities. If you’re breaking it out in public, though, be prepared for this fruity bud’s aroma to attract some attention.\n"

Buds are long and tend to be a lighter shade of green, with an aroma that’s enticing and potent.

        "description": "You can’t even talk about OG marijuana strains without mentioning Mango, a strain that’s been around since the 1960’s. The product we know today was modified back in 1991, as KC33 was crossed with the old-school strain to get this balanced 50/50 hybrid. Winning third place in the indica category during the 2002 High Times’ Cannabis Cup, it was also listed as one of the magazine’s best seeds of 2009.Mango brings a lot to the table with THC levels that can vary, so depending on what you’re looking for, you have some options. Average content hovers around 20%, although it has been found as low as 15% and as high as 24%. Buds can get huge, with various shades of yellow, purple, and green throughout. It has a nice and sweet mango scent that is accented with earthy herbal notes and tastes incredible. Imagine lemon cream, sour mango, and earth all blending into one amazing flavor!This strain acts as a bit of a sneaky one, with a slight high that makes you feel calm and joyous. As you continue through your journey, you’ll end up with a growing sense of energy and a happy attitude that allows you to be creative. Many users notice a body high associated with Mango and primarily note feelings of warm tingles. Although a lot of strains can tend to make you a bit hungry, Mango will likely make you ravenous, so stock up on the snacks beforehand!The positive vibes that come from Mango are what make it such an effective choice for individuals who struggle with stress and depression. Pain management isn’t beyond its reach either, as it can tend to have a numbing effect on the body at times. When smoked in larger doses, Mango can also have a rather sedating effect, making it a good choice for insomniacs.Growing Mango might catch you a bit off guard at first, as it seems like the plants aren’t doing much of anything. While they start off slow, buds eventually reach the size of softballs and can become very heavy for unsupported branches. Expect a high yield after anywhere from 8 to 11 weeks, and grow inside or outside as Mango does either nicely.There’s just something about a strain with a deep lineage that makes you wonder who got high off of it decades ago, and Mango is no exception. Great for smokers who love a strong fruity vibe or for those who need a bit of extra calming energy, you’ll want to keep this one around.\n"

Nonetheless, Light of Jah is a potent choice that will send your senses into overdrive and leave you feeling great. It’s a strain that’s won numerous awards at the High Times’ Cannabis Cup as well.One of the most loved things about this strain is the THC content it brings to the table, with a pretty consistent level that ranges between 24% and 26%. Bold in appearance, nugs are typically a dark green with amber hairs and sparkling trichomes. Light of Jah offers users an experience through multiple senses, as the smell and taste are as unique as the high. It has a spicy and skunky smell that’s rather herbaceous, and a flavor profile that’s woody, peppery, and slightly reminiscent of tropical fruit.Smoking this strain is like boarding a rocketship to euphoria, as you’ll instantly be whisked away to a place of happiness and energetic creativity. A great social strain, Light of Jah allows you to experience strong sativa effects with a slight indica sensation as well. Many users find their bodies take on a slight tingle and a mellow relaxation while their mind stays clear and alert.If you are struggling with stress, anxiety, PTSD, or other mental concerns, Light of Jah is incredible at clearing up your worries and symptoms while providing a great feeling high. Because of its high THC content, it’s also a winner for chronic pain, fatigue, or even inflammation caused by arthritis. Prepare for some munchies too, and if you struggle with your appetite, savor the ability to eat to your heart’s content.Although it’s somewhat difficult to grow your own Light of Jah, it’s certainly not out of the realm of possibility. It’s a plant that can do well inside or outdoors yet requires a fair bit of patience. Averaging a 10 to 13 week flowering cycle, you’ll be rewarded with an immensely high yield of pungent peppery plants.New users should smoke Light of Jah with caution, as it could easily be quite overwhelming. Experienced users tend to favor this strain quite a bit when they need the ultimate mood boost or a way to take the edge off of pain. Make sure to grab some and keep it in your stash for a rainy day!\n"

        "description": "Had a long day and need to unwind? When you’re looking for a strain that will relax you and take away your worries, Locktite is a great choice. RedEyed Genetics did a fantastic job developing this strain, crossing Gorilla Glue #4 and Mt. Rainier for a 70/30 indica-dominant hybrid. While the name might make you think that it will glue you to the couch, it’s more likely that the strain is termed after its sticky appearance.Locktite doesn’t mess around, with THC levels showing up quite consistently in the 22% to 23% range. Many users rave about the characteristics of the buds themselves, as nugs of Locktite are long and dense with an insane amount of crystal-like trichomes. The aroma isn’t so bad either, with a lemon-lime scent containing hints of earthy diesel. Smoking it garners roughly the same experience, with a sweet taste coming to your mouth before the sharp diesel hits you on exhale.When it comes to the effects of this strain, relaxation is the name of the game. Locktite’s high will start with a nice head buzz that seems to wipe your mind clean and leave you feeling happy and comfortable. As you progress through the experience, sedation will slowly enter the rest of your body in a way that’s soothing yet still leaves you functional. Some users will experience couch-lock but it’s not a common trait associated with this strain.Since it does such a great job of erasing stress and worry, Locktite is a perfect choice for medical patients who need a little break from their day to day struggles. Chronic pain, depression, headaches, and even insomnia can all be effectively treated by this particular choice. It’s normal to feel some food cravings during your Locktite high, so if you struggle with your appetite, this strain will be a welcome addition to your stash.A pretty standard crop to grow, this strain can do well inside or outdoors and produces a medium to heavy sized haul. Flowering time can vary based on the conditions, but anywhere from 7 to 9 weeks is recommended. You’ll likely be amazed once you see this strain in its full glory, as it’s so laden with resin that it’s flat-out sticky.Give Locktite a try the next time you want to relax to the fullest level possible. Friday night after a long week of work or even vacation time are great places to experience this strain, as well as any time you need to relieve pain. If you can handle the slight diesel taste, it’ll become a yummy strain that you’ll want to have on-hand.\n"

        "description": "Creating super strong body effects and a sweet and delicate taste, Pink Kush is a 90/10 indica-dominant hybrid with a little bit of a coy attitude. No one is certain about this strain’s lineage, but it’s widely believed that she’s a descendant of OG Kush. This strain lives up to its name with amazing coloration and a powerful high, and is popular in the Pacific Northwest and Canada.Pink Kush aims to please when it comes to THC, with average levels around 20%. Green nugs of this strain are offset by pink pistils and a coating of trichomes that resembles sugar on candy. Almost good enough to eat, Pink Kush’s flavor and odor are heavily accented with vanilla, sweet berries, and floral notes that linger in your mouth in a pleasing way.When it comes to getting high, Pink Kush brings relaxation with a twist of happy giggles. Users will find that they are instantly taken to a euphoric headspace, as even the potential of a negative thought is far from the mind. As the high gets deeper and deeper, you’ll feel light as a feather and wonder how many hours your high will last - hint, the answer is many, many hours. Keep in mind that this strain is known to create munchies that won’t quit, so make sure you have a kitchen full of food or at least your local pizza delivery chain on speed dial.Medical patients tend to gravitate toward Pink Kush for its overwhelming body effects that work to combat physical pain, migraines, and nausea. Used frequently to overcome stress, anxiety, and extreme nervousness, it’s a great way to calm yourself down and enjoy a carefree day. If used later in the evening, smoking a decent amount of this strain will lull you into a deep sleep.As if it couldn’t get any better, Pink Kush is also pretty easy to grow, with plants that produce high yields and are resistant to common molds. The only potential complaint about this gal is that it takes 10 to 11 weeks for her to flower, which for some people can feel like an eternity. Cultivate Pink Kush inside or outdoors for a strain that’s robust and great smelling.Take it easy with Pink Kush, as high doses can cause paranoia - it only takes a little bit to get the job done. If you enjoy a sweet tasting bud that mellows you out with the occasional burst of happiness, this one’s for you.\n"

        "description": "Winner of the 2012 High Times Los Angeles Cannabis Cup and a balanced 50/50 hybrid that makes you feel good in all the right ways, Master Yoda is truly a master of its craft. It was developed by crossing Master Kush and OG Kush, giving it a legacy that it has lived up to. A local favorite in Los Angeles, it’s widely loved by growers and users alike.Master Yoda brings strength with its high, as THC testing regularly shows levels at or above 20%. Buds are light green in color, speckled with orange pistils and completely covered with some of the most frosty trichomes you’ve ever seen. Many say that the aroma of Master Yoda hangs in the air for days, as it’s a strong mixture of dank weed and vanilla, with hints of citrus and pine poking through. The flavor, on the other hand, is far more pleasing, as you are taken on a journey through orange, lemon, and vanilla tastes.Since this strain can reach as high as 28% THC, it’s recommended that newer smokers steer clear. If you know you can handle the high, Master Yoda will come on slowly with a sensation of relaxation and calm. As your mellow vibes begin to build, a sense of euphoria will come along for the ride, and in some cases can create a pretty strong case of couch lock. However, if you just go with the flow and let Master Yoda do its work, you’ll become more relaxed than ever before.Given the deep calming sensations provided by this bud, medical patients who struggle with stress and depression will appreciate how their negative feelings are washed away. As a strain that offers an entire body high, Master Yoda also works well to combat physical pain, including headaches, joint pain, and even spasticity. Expect the munchies after taking a hit, and if you have a tough time with your appetite, count on eating a full meal.Master Yoda is an incredibly resilient plant and can be grown in nearly any environment. Reaching upwards of 6 feet and boasting an odor that lingers quite heavily, think twice before growing outside if you’re concerned about privacy. After about an 8 week flowering cycle, you’ll yield a large harvest that commercial growers rave about.Plan a lazy afternoon or a quiet night at home, then let Master Yoda come out to play. You’ll notice how nicely both the indica and sativa effects are balanced and you can let the worries of a hard day just roll off of your back.\n"

        "description": "Alien Bubba is an otherworldly indica with potent sedative effects and a smooth, herbal flavor. Created by Cali Connections, the same breeders responsible for Jedi Kush, it is a cross between two popular indica strains: Bubba Kush and Cali Connections’ own Alien Kush. More of a strain to take the edge off than to get things done, Alien Bubba is a must-try for fans of heavy indicas. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 21%.Alien Bubba is marked by relatively large flowers that typically have a sharply tapered shape, somewhat like miniature cypress trees. These buds hold together in the dense, compact structure usually associated with other indica varieties. This strain’s tightly-curling leaves are a vivid shade of spring green and are twisted through with plentiful brown and orange hairs (which are properly called pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants). Finally, a sprinkling of crystalline trichomes covers these flowers and makes them particularly sticky to the touch.When properly cured, Alien Bubba has an aroma that is primarily dank and musky, redolent of damp earth. There are also some woodsy notes of pine and cedar lurking underneath. Grinding up these thick flowers releases a rich, hashy odor that pays tribute to the strain’s OG Kush roots. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Alien Bubba burns with a smoke that is surprisingly smooth, given its musty aromatic profile. On the exhale, this smoke tastes woodsy and sweet, with a mildly fruity flavor on the exhale.Alien Bubba has a high that creeps up on the smoker gradually. Once it hits, it can’t be denied, as a concerted pressure takes hold in the forehead and temples. Users are struck by a warped sensory perception, characterized by such odd phenomena as visual distortion and a strong sense of time passing more slowly. The psychedelic nature of these sensations tend to typify the feeling of Alien Bubba’s High, which gives the smoker more of a pleasantly cloudy mindset than a productive, cerebral one. Indeed, Alien Bubba is not a strain to toke before tackling a long day of work or a busy agenda. Instead, use this moody, relaxing strain to set a laid-back, intimate tone. The bud’s relaxing, friendly vibe can be a good way to enjoy some quality time with close, like-minded friends. The strain can also be a great tool for simply kicking back for an extended binge-watching session. Alien Bubba’s effects are primarily distinguished by a pervasive physical relaxation; for the duration of their high, consumers tend to sink into a state of suspended animation, unwilling (and in some cases, unable) to move. If properly relaxed, smokers can simply enjoy the way that this bud eases physical tension and distracts from the pressures and anxieties of daily life. In high enough doses, it can even pull susceptible users into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its primarily sleepy properties, this strain is best reserved for evening and nighttime use.Alien Bubba may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Its physical effects can also soothe pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Some anti-inflammatory properties, meanwhile, can take care of irritations like nausea and headaches. As described, Alien Bubba can also induce sleep, thereby serving as an effective antidote to insomnia. Because it is unlikely to bring about the kind of intense, recursive thinking that leads to paranoia, this strain can be a good choice for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately, Cali Connection has made seeds of Alien Bubba for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Its plants grow short and bushy and have strong lateral branches. Alien Bubba flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers growers a moderate yield of flowers for their efforts.Alien Bubba’s is as enjoyable for cherished alone time as it is for mellow social occasions. All else fails, it can also be a cheap way to vacation, with its spacey vibes transporting you to another, more relaxing planet.\n"

        "description": "Aurora is a potent strain that can plunge its consumers into deep, soothing contemplation. This mostly indica bud was created by Nirvana Seeds, also the purveyors of Bubblicious and Papaya. Aurora is a cross between an Afghani landrace and Northern Lights (from which it derives its name, aurora being the scientific Latin name for the northern lights). What results is a fragrant and highly resinous flower that confers heavy, almost narcotic sedation. Aurora’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 20%.When properly trimmed, flowers of Aurora are usually medium to large in size. They have a distinctive conical shape, tapering from a broad base into a narrow, pointed tip. These fat nuggets have the density and compact structure typically associated with indicas. The tightly-curled leaves are a pale sea green and are twisted through with rich brown and red pistils. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of Aurora’s flowers, making their light-colored leaves appear even paler.Aurora’s flowers give off an earthy, spicy scent that makes the strain’s Afghani roots abundantly clear. On closer inspection, there’s also a fruity, berry-inflected aroma hanging out underneath. Grinding this strain’s flowers, meanwhile, releases woodsy notes of pine and sap. When burnt, Aurora gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke can leave behind a fruity, coffee-tinged flavor on the exhale.Like many other pure indicas, Aurora can be a creeper, requiring several minutes after consumption to take effect. Initial signs that the bud is doing its job range from a tingle around the eyes and temples to a flushing in the cheeks. Some cognitive distortions may be present as well, such as a warping of depth perception (especially in poor lighting) and a powerful sense of time dilation. Most of all, though, Aurora makes itself known with a knockout physical high that may have consumers with a low THC tolerance diving for the closest comfortable couch. Waves of relaxation begin to spread down from the neck, rolling down through the spine and eventually outward through the core and limbs. Limbs can become heavy and unwieldy, while deep breathing may happen more deeply and easily. Under these conditions, it is typically difficult for those under Aurora’s influence to work on complicated analytical tasks -- as well as even basic duties like cleaning the house or running errands. Luckily, even if their bodies are impeded, smokers’ minds tend to remain active and unfettered by everyday inhibitions. This mindset can facilitate creativity, making Aurora a good strain for brainstorming and making lively conversation. As time wears on or as dosage is increased, though, all you may want to pursue is a long nap or an early bedtime. As such, this strain is recommended for nighttime and evening use.Aurora can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can be a temporary balm for the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also dull physical pain, whether due to injury or chronic conditions like lupus or arthritis. As noted, this bud’s sedative power can also send smokers to sleep, serving as a solution to entrenched cases of insomnia. Because it is not especially cerebral and won’t stoke paranoid thinking, Aurora is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or anxiety.Fortunately for home growers, Nirvana has made seeds of Aurora available for sale online. It is considered a forgiving grow and can be especially user-friendly for newcomers to cultivation. Aurora can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its flowering time is unusually long for an indica, at between 9 and 11 weeks when grown indoors; it is ready for harvest in mid-September when grown outdoors.  Once mature, Aurora offers growers a modest yield of about 28 to 37 grams (or 1.3 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Finally, Aurora can be a very pungent crop -- growers trying to maintain discretion should outfit their growing spaces with odor control measures like exhaust fans.Somewhat difficult to come by, Aurora is a strain worth grabbing if spotted on dispensary shelves. If you bring this bud out in a social setting, be prepared for its appealing aroma to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Azure Haze is an indica-dominant hybrid that may seem familiar to some cannabis connoisseurs. Created by famed breeder DJ Short, it has a parentage that’s seemingly identical to that of the uber-popular Blue Dream: DJ Short’s own Blueberry and Super Silver Haze. The difference is that Azure Haze’s Blueberry father comes from an earlier generation of plant stock -- F4 rather than F5. As such, this strain differs somewhat from Blue Dream in effects and physical characteristics. It’s still potent, though, with a THC content measured at between 16% and 20%.Azure Haze is distinguished by its eye-catching flowers, which are typically medium to large in size. These buds have a tapered, pinecone-like shape, culminating in a pointed tip. In structure, the flowers appear more sativa than indica, with their relatively large, ragged leaves spiraling loosely outward from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark olive green and are threaded through by rust-colored pistils. Finally, a coating of translucent white trichomes gives these buds a dewy sheen and a very sticky texture that makes them hard to break up by hand.When they are properly cured, a strong berry odor wafts up Azure Haze’s buds. On closer inspection, there’s also a tangy, sour-sweet scent. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers gives off a whiff of an entirely different blue food: blue cheese. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Azure Haze gives off a smooth, easily palatable smoke. This smoke carries the sweet taste of ripe blueberries on the exhale.The high from Azure Haze has a somewhat slow onset. Eventually, the strain asserts itself with a distinct pressure around the eyes and lower forehead. Some smokers may also notice an increase in their salivation. Once users acclimate to these sensations, though, users enter a newly focused and energetic mindset. Certain thoughts may suddenly occupy more attention than when the user is sober. Inner monologues can also take on a new vibrancy, with ideas and concepts flowing in free association from one to the next. This cerebral mindset can be a good catalyst for getting work done, whether it’s analytical and task-based or more freewheeling and creative. As time passes, a body high sets in, sending waves of relaxation through the body even as the brain remains stimulated. In this latter stage, smokers may feel at ease, free of any lingering muscular tension as well as any prior preoccupations. While not necessarily strong enough to glue its consumers to the couch, Azure Haze’s relaxation can come at the expense of earlier energy and productivity. As with its close relative Blue Dream, this strain’s eventual combination of mental and physical stimulation makes it a good way to appreciate activities that involve both mind and body, like exercise or even sex. Azure Haze is recommended for consumption between late afternoon and early evening, when its taper down from stimulation to sedation can be fully appreciated.Thanks to its powers of relaxation, Azure Haze can also have many uses for medical cannabis patients. In its early phases, its focus can help those with attention deficit disorders to maintainfocus on a single task. The bud’s general even temperament can also help to take the edge off of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Azure Haze can numb pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or minor, like headaches or nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume this strain with caution, as its recursive patterns of thinking can veer into paranoia in the wrong set and setting.DJ Short has made seeds of Azure Haze available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees. Plants grow short and bushy; growers should “top” their crops by trimming away any broad, light-blocking fan leaves that could prevent any low-growing nodes from flowering. Azure Haze flowers within 9 to 10 weeks and offers growers a high yield of flowers for their efforts.Azure Haze is as enjoyable during introspective solo time as it is when shared with friends.If you bring it out in public though, be ready for its distinctive aroma to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Banana Candy, sometimes known as Banana Candy Kush, is a heavy indica with a mysterious backstory. The strain’s creator is undocumented, as it is parentage -- although other strains said to be banana scented, like Banana Kush, Skunk, Haze, and OG Kush in their backgrounds. Whatever its lineage, Banana Candy offers consumers a memorable aroma and a powerful, stoney body high. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 24%.Banana Candy is marked by flowers that are small to medium in size and have a roughly spherical shape. These pebbly buds have the structure characteristic of other indicas, with small leaves overlapping as they curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy green and are twisted through with orange and brownish pistils. Finally, Banana Candy’s flowers are covered in trichomes that appear more amber than white, giving their flowers a yellowish glow when seen from afar.Although fruity and tropical, this strain’s aroma isn’t exactly banana-like. The scent of sweet pine predominates and mixes with fruity base notes. Grinding up these nuggets, meanwhile, yields a skunky pungency, giving further credence to the possibility that Skunk is in this strain’s background. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Banana Candy gives off a smooth and easy smoke. This smoke tastes simultaneously dank and citrusy on the exhale.Banana Candy can take effect slowly, sometimes only makes its presence felt after 10 or 15 minutes. Initial effects include odd changes in sensory perception, with some intensification of certain sights and sounds; some smokers can also detect a warping of depth perception, as well as a sense of time passing more slowly. These uncanny sensations set the tone for Banana Candy’s generally trippy high, one that can be enhanced by a moody playlist or a movie. Soon after adjusting to the high’s onset, though, consumers are plunged into deep physical relaxation that may be so strong as to renders their limbs heavy or even somewhat numb. Any knots of muscular tension are untied and breathing begins to happen more deeply and easily. Though content and relaxed, consumers of Banana Candy are unlikely to feel particularly productive or astute, though. This is not a strain commonly known for its tendency to aid work. Instead, enjoy this fruity bud as a way to kick back with your thoughts. Although lazy, Banana Candy stimulates the mind enough to inspire some free-flowing conversation and camaraderie with like-minded friends. As Banana Candy’s high progresses, its sedation can serve to knock susceptible users out completely, gluing them to the couch or lulling them into a deep and restful sleep. Because of its predominantly sleepy vibes, Banana Candy is best enjoyed at night, or even right before bed.Banana Candy can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its smooth, easygoing high can temporarily take the edge off of cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Its deep, therapeutic body high can also relieve pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. The strain’s anti-inflammatory properties can take care of everyday irritations like nausea or headaches. Because it is unlikely to trigger the kind of cerebral, obsessive thinking associated with paranoia, Banana Candy is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.No breeders have yet grown Banana Candy for commercial purposes, and no seeds of the strain are available for sale online. Prospective growers should obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As a pure indica, the strain’s plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and can be easily accommodated indoors. Banana Candy flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.Banana Candy’s unique and memorable aroma makes it a good novelty strain to share in social situations. For a full fruit salad of cannabis flavors, pair the strain with some Cherry Pie or some Blueberry.\n"

        "description": "Dream Lotus is a riff on the uber-popular hybrid Blue Dream. It was developed by Bodhi Seeds, the purveyors of Tiger’s Milk, and is a cross between Blue Dream and Bodhi’s own resinous Snow Lotus. Like its famous predecessor, Dream Lotus offers subliminally balanced effects and a pleasant aroma. Its easy going high makes it a great choice for cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 10% and 21%.Dream Lotus is marked by small to medium-sized buds that hold together in a pointy, spade-like formation. The chunky buds are compact at their core but have leaves that tend to spiral outward in more sativa-inflected patterns. The leaves themselves are a drab shade of olive green and are twisted through with dark brown and orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, reproductive structures meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. Finally, the nooks and crannies of these small flowers are coated in cloudy white trichomes, making the buds very difficult to break up without a grinder. Flowers of Dream Lotus tend to give off a bright, peppery scent when they’re properly cured. There are also some notes of fruit and blueberries at play. Surprisingly, grinding up the tight buds gives off an herbal aroma, with some traces of vanilla. Dream Lotus gives off a smooth, richly-scented smoke when it is combusted in a pipe or a joint. This silky smoke tastes both spicy and woodsy on the exhale. Dream Lotus can be a creeper of a strain, taking several minutes after users have toked to reveal its full force. When it shows itself, the high arrives as a concerted pressure around the eyes and in the upper half of the face. Some consumers may also experience an increase in salivation. Once they get used to these unfamiliar sensations, smokers can beg to settle into the strain’s high, which is initially marked by an increase in mental stimulation. Thoughts may take on a new intensity, stopping to dwell on certain concepts or making rapid and surprising associations. Under the right conditions, this upbeat, energetic change in thinking can make some consumers exceptionally outgoing and chatty. Dream Lotus is right at home, then, in social situations, where it can foster free-flowing conversation and camaraderie. Dream Lotus can also unlock hidden creativity, inspiring bouts of open-ended brainstorming or work on personal projects like crafts. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, this bud’s physical relaxation becomes more and more apparent. A tingle in the limbs can soon lead to a feeling of heaviness and fatigue. Smokers who are so inclined can take a load off on the closest couch and enjoy some moody music or a visually-engaging movie or TV show. Though not strong enough to couchlock or totally incapacitate consumers, Dream Lotus’ high may eventually put a damper on any prior energy or motivation. Luckily, the strain’s mental properties remain constant, allowing the newly-relaxed user to sustain thoughtfulness and an uplifted mood. Because of its slow decrease in energy levels, Dream Lotus is best enjoyed between late afternoon and early evening.This strain’s versatile effects may also have some surprising benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its early sense of fast-paced thinking can help sustain focus for those who have attention deficit disorders. Blue Lotus’ laidback vibes may also temporarily take the edge off of come cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. This bud’s body high can be an effective painkiller for physical afflictions as well, whether they’re chronic and disease-related or simply due to everyday inflammation or injury.

        "description": "Barbara Bud is an indica with a strong, subduing body high and a surprisingly tropical aroma. The creation of British Columbia-based breeders House of the Great Gardener, Barbara Bud is a cross between flavorful Shiskaberry and an Afghani indica landrace. The strain’s therapeutic sedative effects and bag appeal have earned it several European and Canadian cannabis awards. Its THC content has been measured at between 10% and 19%. Some phenotypes of Barbara Bud are also bred for high levels of CBD.Flowers of Barbara Bud are typically medium to large in size and have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. These long buds make their indica heritage clear with compact, densely-packed leaves that curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a pale sage green and are twisted through with hairy, copper-colored pistils. Finally, a blanket of translucent white trichomes covers the surfaces of these flowers and gives their pale leaves a white, almost silvery sheen when viewed from afar.When properly cured, Barbara Bud carries a fruity tropical essence. On closer inspection, there’s also a mellow undertone with some dank, earthy notes. Meanwhile, grinding up Barbara’s thick buds gives off a hashy, spicy scent that reveals the double dose of Afghani in the strain’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, the flowers burn with a smooth, pleasant smoke. This smoke tastes like tangy citrus on the exhale.Barbara Bud’s high creeps up on the user with initially subtle effects. Smokers begin to detect Barbara’s effects after a few minutes as a tingle around the eyes and temples. At the same time, many consumers also notice a general improvement in mood, with any prior stresses or preoccupations melting into the background. Barbara Bud works primarily on the body, sending feelings of relaxation through the core and extremities. Consumers may feel relief from any muscular soreness; several are also able to breathe more deeply and easily. Fortunately, this strain is not known to be a knockout and can be savored without incapacitating users by gluing them to the couch. There’s also a relative lack of intense cerebral stimulation, although some increase in freely-associative thinking can help to keep the conversation flowing in buzzy social situations. As such, Barbara Bud can be a pleasant background accompaniment in a variety of settings, helping to take the edge off as you plow through a mountain of work or to set the stage for some mellow solo time. As this high wears on, the physical effects become somewhat more intense and may have susceptible smokers heading for the closest comfortable surroundings in which to take a load off. Overall, though, this strain’s mellow balance of physical and mental stimulation is a good end-of-day treat that allows  fans to function as they ordinarily would. Because its feelings of relaxation are pleasant but not overwhelming, Barbara Bud is appropriate for consumption between the afternoon and evening.This strain’s versatile effects can also have potential uses for medical cannabis patients. Its mood-altering properties can temporarily improve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Barbara Bud can also ease physical discomfort, ranging from injury-related pain to the chronic pain that comes from conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. Meanwhile, anti-inflammatory properties can soothe common irritations like headaches. Finally, Barbara Bud may stimulate hunger, making it a useful supplement for those who experience decreased appetite due to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Because it is not known to bring about the kind of intense, obsessive thinking marked by more sativa-dominant strains, this bud is a good choice for those who are prone to panic or paranoia.Fortunately for home growers, seeds of Barbara Bud are available through several online retailers. It can be cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy and can be easily accommodated in indoor growing environments. Barbara Bud flowers within a brief 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.Thanks to its balanced high and relatively modest THC levels, Barbara Bud is a solid option for cannabis newcomers, or for those with a low THC tolerance. The strain’s high resin content also makes it valuable in the production of hash.\n"

        "description": "Not to be confused with popular indica Big Bud, BC Big Bud is actually descended from that strain. BC Big Bud is the creation of British Columbia-based growers Jordan of the Islands and riffs on the indica genetics of Big Bud by crossing it with an unspecified sativa. The result is a fruity strain that offers an excellent balance of head and body effects. Like Big Bud, BC Big Bud is also known for exceptionally large flowers and a high yield come harvest time. This strain’s THC levels clock in at between 12% and 21%.True to its name, BC Big Bud produces huge, chunky flowers. These buds typically have a spherical shape, slightly smaller than a golf ball, and are densely packed, with their small leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. These overlapping leaves themselves are a dark mossy green and are shot through with curly orange and brown pistils. Translucent white trichomes cap off these already-colorful flowers, giving them a white sheen and making them very sticky and difficult to break up by hand.The most apparent aroma of BC Big Bud’s flowers is the musky, pungent scent of skunk. Lurking underneath is a more dank, earthy odor, reminiscent of damp soil. Grinding up these large nuggets gives off a rich, spicy scent, possibly passed on from Afghani. When burnt, BC Big Bud gives off a smoke that can be harsh and acrid, stinging the palate and making eyes water. Nevertheless, this smoke carries a pleasantly sweet and piney taste on the exhale.BC Big Bud’s effects assert themselves relatively quickly, beginning with a concerted pressure around the eyes and forehead shortly after consumption. Some smokers may also detect a flush in the face or an increase in salivation. These odd sensations are met with an uptick in cerebral patterns of thinking. In particular, users may tend to dwell on ideas or concepts that might not otherwise hold a fascination for them. Some may also be struck by a freely-associative energy that causes them to jump around from one topic to the next. This mindset can be effective for executing tasks, whether they’re complicated and work-related or more basic and mundane, like doing the dishes. As time passes or as dosage is increased, BC Big Bud’s indica side begins to assert itself, with progressive feelings of relaxation rolling down the neck and taking hold in the core and limbs. While not laid out flat by the bud’s relaxing properties, smokers may be more likely to kick back on the closest comfortable couch, or at least to feel a general relief of tension and stress. At this point, BC Big Bud’s combination of mental and physical relaxation can be an ideal way to savor activities that require both brain and body coordination, including exercising, gaming, and sex. BC Big Bud’s elevated but soothing energy can also be a good way to enhance buzzy social situations, inspiring free and easy conversation and good vibes among like-minded friends. This strain’s versatility makes it appropriate for enjoyment throughout the day, although consumers should avoid it just before bed when the sativa onset is liable to keep them wide awake.BC Big Bud can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can aid focus for those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on a single task. The strain may also temporarily improve the harsh symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, BC Big Bud can also relieve pain that’s due to injury, chronic conditions like lupus, or simple irritations like headaches and indigestion. Because its early effects may bring about some intense, recursive patterns of thinking, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic and paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of BC Big Bud are available from several online retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Whichever environment they choose, growers should note that BC Big Bud can be particularly sensitive to excessive moisture. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. This strain flowers within a short 7 to 8 weeks indoors and is ready for harvest in early October outdoors. As flowering begins, growers should take care to tie their crops’ branches to supports like wooden dowels in order to keep them from sagging under the weight of these huge buds.BC Big Bud is a welcome enhancement to both solo and social settings. When shared with friends, its large and eye-catching buds can be a fun conversation starter, from grinding to smoking.\n"

        "description": "With a name like BC Roadkill, you may be hesitant to sample this bold strain -- and while its strong, pungent aroma is indeed an acquired taste, its smooth, indica-dominant high does a great deal to recommend it. Created in British Columbia, Canada, BC Roadkill is a cross between hybrid BC Roadkill Skunk and pure indica Deep Chunk. The result is a stinky but potent strain that’s suitable for a wide variety of situations. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 12% and 25%.BC Roadkill’s flowers are usually medium to large and ahdere in shapes that range from elongated and cylindrical to tapered and spadelike. These buds have a typically indica structure, with their small leaves overlapping and curling tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green; sometimes, phenotypes of BC Roadkill also boast flashes of blue and purple in their leaves. These latter hues come about when pigments called anthocyanins in the strain’s genetics are agitated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, cloudy, translucent trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks of these dense flowers, giving them a slightly white sheen.On first inspection, BC Roadkill takes after its parent strain BC Roadkill Skunk, giving off a funky pungency. A second whiff of these flowers reveals some more pleasant citrus notes lurking underneath. Grinding up the buds yields a hashy, somewhat herbal odor. When burnt, BC Roadkill is just as offensive, with a harsh and sour smoke that trigger watery eyes and coughing fits. On the exhale, this smoke is skunky, with some light fruity flavors on the exhale.BC Roadkill’s effects come on slowly, sometimes requiring as long as 15 minutes after consumers have finished coughing on its smoke to reveal its presence. Once the high rears its head, though, it exerts a pressure around the upper face and forehead, accompanied by a tendency toward increased salivation. Along with these sensations, many smokers also experience a distortion of sensory perception, characterized by slight visual and auditory hallucinations, as well as an uncanny sense of time passing more slowly. If users so inclined, they can amplify these trippy properties even further by immersing themselves in atmospheric music or visually engaging movies. BC Roadkill’s mental properties typically involve a moderate increase in focus, with some free association occurring in the consumers’ thought processes. If sufficiently motivated, some may find themselves able to work on complicated, analytical tasks, as well as any open-ended creative projects. Overall, though, BC Roadkill’s high is a smooth, mellow ride that provides a pleasant backdrop to activities like a binge-watching session or a low-key night in with friends. As time passes or as dosage is increased, BC Roadkill’s physical effects can become even more pronounced, weighing down eyelids and limbs in equal measure. Because of its mostly sleepy vibes, this strain is recommended for enjoyment in the evening or nighttime.BC Roadkill can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its mood-altering effects can help to briefly alleviate the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also numb physical pain, whether it’s a chronic and disease-related affliction or everyday irritations like a headache. In high enough doses, BC Roadkill can even lull insomniacs into a deep and restful sleep. Because it is not known to have intensely cerebral effects, the strain is a solid choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.BC Roadkill’s breeder Cannacopia has made seeds of the strain available online. It can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and can be easily accommodated indoors. BC Roadkill flowers within 8 weeks when grown inside and offers a moderate yield of up to 42 grams (or 1.5 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.With potent -- but not debilitating -- effects, BC Roadkill is a must-try for indica fans. Its pungency can carry for quite a distance, though, so growers and smokers looking to maintain discretion should invest in some odor-control precautions.\n"

        "description": "Belladonna is a sativa-dominant hybrid with a memorable aroma and stimulating, long-lasting effects. Produced by Paradise Seeds, the same growers of Nebula and Delahaze, this fruity bud is a cross between pungent Super Skunk and an unnamed sativa. Belladonna’s effects being with some cerebral concentration and taper off into smooth relaxation. Like the hallucinogenic plant for which it may be named, this strain can also be a particularly psychedelic smoke in the right set and setting. Belladonna’s THC content has been measured at between 14% and 26%.Somewhat visually underwhelming, Belladonna’s flowers tend to be small when trimmed and cling together in tight, popcorn-like clusters. These buds have the dense, compact structure often associated with indica-dominant varieties, with their leaves curling tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a patchwork of dark and light green and are twisted through with brown (and occasionally red) pistils. Finally, a coating of frosty white trichomes covers these flowers, making them appear almost icy when seen from afar.When properly cured, flowers of Belladonna have a fruity aroma, with distinct notes of berry and peach. On closer inspection, there is also a dank and earthy base that grounds out these fruity top notes. Meanwhile, grinding the small buds gives off a faint tang of cheese. Belladonna burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke when combusted in a pipe or a joint. This smoke can carry a cocoa flavor on the exhale and leaves behind a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.Belladonna’s high takes effect rather quickly, beginning with a pressure exerted around the eyes. Some smokers may also experience a flush in their cheeks. The high tends to affect the head at first lending the consumer’s thought a fast-paced, cerebral quality. Some ideas or external stimuli may occupy more attention that they ordinarily might. As such, in these early stages, the strain can be a good way to focus on complex and analytical tasks. Belladonna can also have the effect of sparking rapid associations in thinking, making it a good way to hasten creative processes like brainstorming or sketching. After an hour or so, Belladonna’s more relaxing properties take precedence. Any prior mental chatter may become more subdued as the body eases into a loose and tension-free state. At this point, changes in the senses, such as feelings of time dilation and a warping of depth perception, may set in and can be boosted by putting on some atmospheric music. Despite this new sedation, Belladonna still leaves consumers’ minds functional and able to follow a conversation or execute basic tasks. As such, this bud is a good option for enjoying a solo binge-watching session or for kicking back after a long day with some good friends. If dosage is increased, couchlock becomes increasingly likely for tired smokers. Because of its gradual decrescendo in energy, Belladonna is best enjoyed during the late afternoon or early evening.Belladonna’s versatility can also be useful for many medical cannabis patients. It can sustain focus on single tasks for those with attention deficit disorders. It can also temporarily relieve the draining symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. On the physical end of the spectrum, the strain has the ability to soothe pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as caused by conditions like lupus or fibromyalgia. Because Belladonna’s onset is associated with cerebral thinking and potential “mindrace,” it is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who are very sensitive to THC.Paradise Seeds has made seeds of Belladonna available through several online retailers. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70s and 80s. The strain’s hardy plants can be especially resistant to mold and can thrive in very humid conditions. These plants tend to grow tall and may need to be trimmed back occasionally if cultivated indoors. Belladonna flowers within 10 weeks when grown inside and is ready for harvest in mid-October when grown outdoors. Belladonna’s multilayered high can be a fun addition to buzzy social situations. The strain’s high resin output also makes it valuable in the production of hash and other THC concentrates.\n"

        "description": "Birds Eye is a sativa-leaning strain that may look somewhat familiar to many experienced cannabis consumers. Created by Canadian breeders Tweed, Inc., this strain is a distinct phenotype of perennial favorite Jack Herer is similarly made up of genetics from Northern Lights, Shiva Skunk, and Haze. Like Jack Herer, Birds Eye has a fruity, citrus-tinged aroma and a well-rounded high. Its THC content has been measured at between 16% and 25%.Birds Eye is marked by medium-sized flowers that hold a spadelike shape, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. These buds have an indica-typical silhouette, with their leaves densely packed in compact bundles. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green and are wound through with vivid orange hairs (which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants). Finally, white trichomes make these buds very sticky and cause them to appear pale and dewy when viewed from a distance.When properly cured, Birds Eye’s well-formed flowers give off a punchy orange scent. There’s also an undeniable hint of fresh pine hanging out underneath. Grinding up or breaking open the flowers yields peppery and herbal notes, likely passed on from Haze. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Birds Eyes burns with a very smooth smoke. This smoke offers the pleasant taste of pine mixed with citrus on the exhale.Birds Eye takes effect within short order, putting a pressure on consumers’ temples and forehead. Some smokers may also feel a sudden flush in the cheeks. At the same time, the strain introduces a new mental clarity, focusing consumers’ thoughts on ideas or on external stimuli that might not otherwise capture their attention. Inner (as well as some outer) monologues can become freewheeling, jumping in free association from one topic to the next. In such conditions, those under Birds Eye’s influence may find themselves equipped to take on work-related tasks involving analysis or problem-solving. Birds Eye can also open up imaginative pathways, helping to facilitate creative projects or brainstorms. As the high wears on, some subtle feelings of physical relaxation set in and can cause some users to feel slightly dizzy or sluggish; if they aren’t already sitting down, many may want to seek out the closest couch. Fortunately, though, this strain's body high does not come at the expense of its cerebral energy. Even as they kick back, smokers are typically able to maintain a lucid train of thought or carry on conversations. For these reasons, Birds Eye can be a very good strain to share in buzzy social settings with some close friends. If the dosage is increased, beware that this strain can cloud any previously clear-eyed thinking, replacing it with daydreaming and couchlock. Because of its gradual decrease in energy, Birds Eye is recommended for consumption between the afternoon and evening.Birds Eye can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its balanced, easygoing effects may temporarily improve the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. It can also help relieve physical pain, both chronic and mild. For some, the strain can even work against insomnia, lulling them into a fulfilling sleep. Because its early feelings of cerebral “mindrace” can prove overwhelming in the wrong set and setting, those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance should consume Birds Eye with some caution and moderation.Seeds of Birds Eye do not seem to be available for sale online. As such, prospective growers should seek out clippings of the strain from a trusted source. There is no information available regarding best practices for growing this specific strain, but given its close genetic relation to Jack Herer, we can extrapolate that it can be grown indoors or outdoors in a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Its similarity to Jack Herer also suggests that this strain flowers within 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid to late October when grown outdoors.Birds Eye has a versatile high and a universally appealing flavor that makes it especially fun to share with others. Tweed, Inc. also manufactures the strain as a tincture, allowing for oral absorption and a more gradual onset.\n"

        "description": "Black Bubba (not to be confused with Bubba Black) is a richly-flavored strain with mostly indica roots. It is a cross between Bubba Kush and Canadian-born The Black. The result is a bud with a knockout body high and all the hashy pungency of its predecessors. Produced by Northern California growers CSI: Humboldt, Black Bubba is a must-try for fans of heavy indicas. The strain’s THC levels have been recorded at between 15% and 24%.Black Bubba exhibits medium to large-sized flowers that are shaped almost like miniature pinecones. These indica-typical buds are densely packed, with leaves that curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark mossy green and sometimes, as with parent strain The Black, phenotypes of Black Bubba can show off flashes of dark blue or purple in their leaves. These latter colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Translucent white trichomes cap off these already-vivid flowers, giving them an icy appearance and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Black Bubba’s flowers give off an earthy scent with some hints of roasted coffee. On closer inspection, there’s also a fresh, piney aroma. Meanwhile, grinding up these dense flowers yields the rich odor of sandalwood and hash, possibly inherited from the OG Kush in this strain’s background. When burnt, Black Bubba gives off a smoke that is surprisingly smooth, given its rich, heavy flavor profile. This smoke tastes earthy with some floral sweetness on the exhale.Black Bubba’s high often takes several minutes to take effect. Up to 15 minutes after enjoying its luxurious smoke, consumers may begin to feel uch odd sensations as an increase in salivation and a slight pressure or a flushing in the face. Many may also experience trippy phenomena related to sensory perception, including visual distortions of depth and a feeling of time passing more slowly. In these early stages, Black Bubba’s psychedelic properties can be intensified by media like moody music. Once adjusted to the strain’s onset, smokers begin to notice the weight of its physical relaxation. Symptoms like weighty limbs and droopy eyelids may have some making a beeline for the closest comfortable surroundings. Indeed, Black Bubba is well-suited to such passive activities as binge-watching or solo reading. Any mental stimulation that the strain exerts is sure to be subtle, manifesting more as a kind of free association in the user’s stream-of-consciousness, rather than as an intense cerebral focus. It would be a mistake to toke on Black Bubba before taking on a heavy workload or tackling a lengthy to-do list. Instead, enjoy this strain as you kick back at the end of a long day or week of work and be prepared for the outside world to recede into the background. It may go without saying that, due to its sleepy vibes, Black Bubba is best enjoyed during the evening or nighttime.Black Bubba’s sedation can also be useful for many medical cannabis patients. It may temporarily take the edge off of certain symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also soothe physical pain, whether that pain is temporary and injury-related, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or lupus. Black Bubba’s anticonvulsive properties may even counteract the symptoms of afflictions like restless leg syndrome. In the right conditions, this strain can work against insomnia, lulling smokers into a deep and satisfying sleep. Because it is not known to induce intense, recursive patterns of thinking, this strain may be a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Seeds of Black Bubba are available through several digital retailers. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branches. Growers looking to bring out their crops’ blue and purple potential should briefly expose the plants to temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees below average. Black Bubba flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors.With a bag appeal exemplified by colorful flowers and a complex flavor profile, Black Bubba makes a great conversation starter in social settings. If you do enjoy this bud at parties, though, prepare for imminent couchlock.\n"

        "description": "Mega Jackpot is a sativa-leaning hybrid that takes advantage of its legendary genetics. This larger than life strain is a cross between stoney Northern Lights, tasty Jack Herer, and sativa staple Haze. These popular varieties combine to create a bud that’s useful for crushing stress as well as stimulating creativity. Mega Jackpot is especially memorable for its sweet and fruity aroma. This strain is consistently found to have high levels of THC, testing at between 20% and 25%.Mega Jackpot’s flowers set themselves apart right away with their relatively large size. These thick buds have an elongated, almost cylindrical shape and a pronounced sativa-type bud structure. The piecey, fluffy leaves cling loosely to their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mossy shade of green, although phenotypes of this strain frequently boast vivid patches of purple. These latter hues come about when anthocyanin pigments in the plant’s genetics are activated by colder than average temperatures during the growing process. Finally, Mega Jackpot’s flowers are dotted with translucent white trichomes that account for their high psychoactivity and give it a dewy sheen when viewed from afar.Although a true jackpot requires players to hit triple cherries or lemons on their slot machine, Mega Jackpot offers a much wider array of fruity options. When properly cured, Mega Jackpot’s buds burst with tangy notes of berry and grape. On closer inspection, there are also some hints of vanilla. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these fluffy buds reveals some of the herbal, sage-like characteristics that will be familiar to fans of Haze. When combusted, Mega Jackpot burns with a smooth and palatable smoke that tastes like vanilla and fruit on the exhale.The high from Mega Jackpot hits quickly, smacking users with a pressure in the upper face, as well as a tendency toward increased salivation. Some changes in sensory perception, like seeing more vivid colors, may happen subtly without seeming disorienting. Smokers are likely to be struck by a suddenly fast-paced, freely-associative way of thinking. Certain thoughts and ideas may occupy more attention than they otherwise might. Unlike some more pure sativas, though, Mega Jackpot allows its consumers to remain lucid and functional, able to carry on conversations or tackle a mountain of work. This bud also makes a good accompaniment to all sorts of activities, from taking a long walk to cleaning the house. Some slight physical relaxation creeps in as the high progresses, bringing any buzzy, high-flying minds back down to earth. Though they may be relieved of muscular tension and able to breathe more deeply, consumers won’t necessarily be incapacitated by these soothing effects. Instead, Mega Jackpot’s combination of mental and physical stimulation is good for activities that involve both, including exercising, dancing, and in the right setting, sex. This strain is as enjoyable for mellow solo use as it is for boisterous social settings. Its energy makes it appropriate for use at almost any time of day -- although if used before bed, it could keep smokers wired and awake.Mega Jackpot’s versatile effects can have applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can aid focus for patients with attention deficit disorders. The strain may also temporarily improve the symptoms of stress and depression. Some subtle physical effects might numb aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, resulting from conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Mega Jackpot can also have an anti-inflammatory effect on common irritations like headaches and indigestion. Because its onset can be intense and head-focused, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Several online retailers sell seeds of Mega Jackpot for the home grower. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate with constant daytime sunlight. Plants tend to be tall, and growers should tame their height with regular pruning early in the vegetative stage. Like many other sativas, Mega Jackpot has a long flowering time of about 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors. Once mature, it may offer up to 56 grams (or 2 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.Whether you’re looking for mental stimulation or physical relaxation, Mega Jackpot can help you win big. It’s an excellent option for smokers who’d like a head high without the disorienting feeling of mindrace.\n"

        "description": "Though not as famous as its cousin strain Maui Wowie, Maui is a potent sativa native to Hawaii. This landrace strain offers smokers steadily mounting cerebral effects that may even culminate in euphoria. Maui is a useful tool for motivation as well as for buzzy entertainment. Maui also has an appealing tropical flavor that feels characteristic of its birthplace. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found flowers of this strain to have between 16% and 26% THC.Maui impresses right away with large, solid flowers. These buds hold together in an almost cylindrical, elongated shape. The buds have the loose, piecey structure that is characteristic of sativa varieties -- the fluffy leaves can be easily torn away from their central stems. Maui’s leaves are a vibrant shade of spring green and are twisted through with dark rust-colored pistils. A blanket of cloudy white trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces of these large flowers, giving them a sticky texture and making them even more colorful than they already are.When they’re properly cured, Maui’s flowers give off a powerful aroma redolent of fresh lemon zest. On closer inspection, there’s also a dank, skunky odor lurking underneath these bright scents. Meanwhile, breaking apart Maui’s fluffy buds yields pungent notes of skunk, providing further contrast to its fruitiness. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Maui burns with a smooth and palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke has a tropical, almost pineapple taste.As with many pure sativa strains, Maui’s buzzy effects take hold quickly. Smokers may feel a sudden tingle or a pressure around the eyes and forehead. Some changes to sensory perception can be expected, ranging from intensified sights and sounds to powerful feelings of time dilation. As users adjust to these odd sensations, they may also notice that their thoughts take on a fast-paced, freely-associative character. This cerebral mindset can be useful for accomplishing task-based, analytical work, as well as more open-ended creative pursuits. Maui’s high may also be a good way to enhance mundane activities like cleaning the house or running a long list of errands. When shared in social settings, this strain may spark easy conversation and camaraderie among friends and strangers alike. Consumers should note that in certain circumstances, this bud’s intense, recursive patterns of thought can prove disorienting or overwhelming. Maui comes with almost no discernible physical effects, leaving consumers mobile and clear-headed enough to power through a busy agenda. Because of its stimulating effects and relative lack of couchlock, Maui is best enjoyed during the day -- it makes an ideal wake-and-bake strainMaui’s energetic properties may also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its long-lasting sense of focus may be of aid to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on single tasks. Its buzzy, upbeat character can also temporarily improve the difficult symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. On the physical side, this strain’s subtly relaxing effects can ease mild, muscle-related aches as well as chronic, nerve-based pain. Its anti-inflammatory properties may also soothe annoyances like headaches and nausea. As noted, its mindrace can be too fast-paced for some -- Maui is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia or who have a low tolerance for THC.Although some seeds that are available online purport to be authentic Maui, home growers should use discretion in buying seed stock of this landrace. Clippings from mature, healthy plants of Maui can be grown as genetically identical “clones.” Once obtained it can be grown indoor or outdoors in climates similar to those of its native Hawaii. That said, this bud’s pure landrace background gives it the hardiness to survive many adverse growing conditions. As with most pure sativas, these plants can grow to be very tall; growers can manage this height by pruning back the plants early on in the vegetative stage.Maui is as enjoyable for introspective solo use as it is for buzzy social use. If you break it out in public, be sure bring enough to share, as Maui’s tropical aroma is certain to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "A strain that’s highly prized in California, Purple Crack is a bit of a newcomer to the cannabis scene. There can be two different variations of this beauty on the market, one created by Cali Connection and another that’s put out by Qola Family. Cali’s version is bred by crossing Green Crack with a Blackwater male, while Qola’s seems to be the more widely seen selection. They’ve taken Green Crack and combined it with Juicy Fruit for an 85/15 sativa-dominant strain that’s pungent and potent.Purple Crack hits harder than you’d think with its 17% THC average. Nugs are super frosty with pistils that are often purple instead of the usual amber tone. This strain’s scent is something to be noted, with a complex and sharp aroma lingering during each smoke session. It’s floral, spicy, and has a hint of pine that’s quite nice. Its flavor profile is rather similar, although a sweeter and more earthy set of flavors tend to come into your mouth with a very definite aftertaste.Tread carefully with Purple Crack, because a little goes a long way. Many note that they begin to feel its strong sativa effects literally within 5 minutes, taking them on an uplifted and happy ride. You’ll be hit with a burst of creative energy that’s perfect for getting projects completed or tackling an overdue task list. Despite your increased mood, you’ll still feel relaxed and the busyness won’t make you feel like you’re rushing around as other strains tend to. The high will be rather short, but intense enough to make it worth it.Although you’ll be coming down sooner than you may like, this strain will still suffice as a great choice for medical patients. It’s highly effective for those dealing with chronic stress and depression and does wonders for pain relief. Despite many noticing increased energy after smoking Purple Crack, individuals with ADHD, muscle spasms, and insomnia might find they head right to sleep after a few puffs.Growing Purple Crack isn’t too terribly difficult to do, as long as you’re prepared. She flowers in about 7 to 8 weeks, and at full maturity will give off a very strong skunky aroma. Indoor growing environments are recommended, where it can top heights of about 6 feet. However, if you choose to opt for an outdoor setting, be aware that you’re looking at plants that will be around 10 feet or more.Purple Crack is a great way to get your high on and then move to the rest of your day unaffected, as its short but intense high can put you in a great frame of mind. Users love this strain’s unique flavor and it’s a great choice for both recreational and medicinal smokers.\n"

This strain is a hybrid of unknown origins, resulting in a choice that brings both indica and sativa effects in vague ratios. Expert cultivators believe that Purple Cream might be the offspring of Skunk and a type of Kush, but little is known about the history of this lovely lady.THC levels are all over the place with Purple Cream. Perhaps due to such limited information out there, growers are ending up with all kinds of variations that range in how much they pack a punch. In general, Purple Cream offers from 10% all the way up to 24% but tends to average around 18%. Sticky and dense nugs are highlighted by frosty trichomes and a nice spattering of orange pistils. A sweet and floral aroma will instantly overtake your nose, with a fruity and earthy flavor palate that will dance around your mouth.Purple Cream is the ultimate relaxation strain, with a complete mind and body high that differs from sativa-dominant choices. Even with a version that’s lower in THC, you’ll immediately feel washed clean of all worry, happy beyond belief, and might even come down with a few giggles here and there. Due to how mellow this strain will make you feel, it’s not uncommon to become glued to your couch or to fall asleep unexpectedly.For these reasons, medicinal cannabis users absolutely love the effects of Purple Cream. Those who have a hard time letting go of negative thoughts and who are plagued by stress and depression can rely on this strain for letting them unwind and cheer up. If you suffer from body pain, nausea, or insomnia, the powerful relaxing effects of Purple Cream will do you right in no time at all.Growing Purple Cream at home isn’t difficult, but finding your own cutting to cultivate might be nearly impossible. Should you get your hands on a rare piece, this strain will follow typical indica growth characteristics, flowering in approximately 8 weeks. She isn’t too picky when it comes to soil choice or environment, but Sea of Green techniques are recommended in order to get a decent yield once it’s time to harvest.For a high that will practically melt you into a big puddle of human, give Purple Cream a try. Keep in mind that it can bring about a dry mouth, dizziness, or even a headache if you overdo it. If you end up growing your own, make this strain one of the most prized plants in your collection.\n"

This strain is a sativa-dominant hybrid that’s a four-time backcross of Ch9 Aroma. Creators at Ch9 Female Seeds have done a fine job of keeping this strain’s data a mystery, as not much is known about its exact ratio or common THC levels. Taking a chance on Tangerine, however, will probably pay off handsomely regardless of its numbers.What has been determined is that Tangerine’s THC level can rise as high as 18%, although an average testing range is not publicized. Users instead focus on this strain’s insane smell and flavor profile, that will make you think you’ve been transported to the citrus groves of Florida. Orange, mango, and pineapple fragrances all blend together for a scent that will make your mouth water, and these same tastes will stick around long after you exhale. Nugs of Tangerine are bright green and boast an intensely thick layer of sandy trichomes.Tangerine is a great daytime choice for new or experienced users, as you’ll enjoy a plethora of effects that all leave you fully functional. Initially a head high will result in strong feelings of happiness and incredible amounts of energy. While this can sometimes make people feel jittery or experience anxiety, your high will be smooth and enjoyable. As you shift into the indica effects, your body will become more relaxed without any sense of sleepiness.Boasting a rather high CBD amount of 2%, Tangerine is a medical patient’s dream come true. Since it’s great for any time of day, try using it to relieve stress at the office or as a daily smoke to get through a depressing stretch of life - we all have them. Those with chronic body pain, inflammation, or migraines will appreciate the way that this strain takes the edge off and can make you more functional. Some patients find that the relaxing benefits of its indica side can help them achieve a great night of sleep as well.Again, limited data makes it tough to give exact recommendations if you’re trying to grow Tangerine at home. What is known, however, is that she will do well either indoors or outside, and with a 7 to 8 week flowering time, there probably isn’t anything overly nuanced to worry about.Keep some Tangerine handy the next time you want to taste the best bud of your life. It could become your new daily favorite, or you may reserve it for special occasions where you want to have a carefree and energetic day.\n"

Decent THC levels and a yummy flavor make it a favorite - if you can find it.Black Velvet ranks with many other hybrids in a moderate THC zone, with lab tests ranging from 15% to 20%. Nugs are quite sticky, making it difficult to roll a joint, yet are beautiful with a purple-black tint to them. As far as the aroma and taste are concerned, Black Velvet is high up on the charts.

Boosting your mood and creativity, users may find that they’re able to sit and focus on one task for a certain length of time. However, once your body begins to buzz and you’ve melted away into a total state of relaxation, all thoughts of productivity might go out the window.Used primarily for its antidepressant properties, Black Velvet is very effective for medical patients.

Although they do well inside or outdoors, you’ll find yourself waiting 9 to 10 weeks for their flowering cycle to kick in, and heavy colas might need a little bit of your attention along the way. Plants are easy to manage though, with heights that won’t take over your whole grow space.Those with a high tolerance might love Black Velvet as a daytime strain to help focus the mind and lighten the mood, however many find that it just makes them too sedated to fully function.

The latter two colors are thanks to the presence of anthocyanins, pigments in the strain’s genetics that are activated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover these already-eye-catching flowers, giving them a soft silvery sheen and a very sticky texture.\n\nWhen properly cured, Red Poison’s colorful flowers give off a sweet and fruity aroma, with distinct notes of citrus and grape. There’s also a dank undertone, with a decidedly more musky aroma. Meanwhile, grinding up the dense flowers releases some unexpected notes of spice and cocoa. Red Poison gives off a very smooth and easily palatable smoke when it’s burned. This smoke tastes fruity and woodsy on the exhale.\n\n\nRed Poison’s pleasantly poisonous effects creep up on the smoker slowly, sometimes taking as long as 15 minutes to reveal themselves. At first, consumers may notice an increase in the pulse around their eyes and temples along with some possible flushing in the cheeks. Soon afterward, this strain begins to affect cognition and sensory perception, creating such phenomena as visual and auditory distortions as well as a powerful feeling of time dilation. If you’re comfortable with psychedelic properties like these, feel free to revel in them with some moody music or some visually engaging art. While Red Poison provides some mental stimulation, it’s not likely to induce the kind of cerebral intensity that you’d get with a strong sativa like Durban Poison or Trainwreck. As such, this bud is great for livening up mundane tasks like cleaning the house or running errands, but may not necessarily help you execute complex, work-related tasks. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, Red Poison’s physical sensation tends to intensify, relieving any lingering muscular tension and helping to facilitate deep and even breathing. If you’re so inclined, kick back and enjoy this sense of body melt as outside stresses and preoccupations melt into the background. Red Poison can be an especially good way to pass time with like-minded friends, as its mix of effects can encourage conversation and camaraderie. Because of its mostly slow-moving, dreamy properties, Red Poison is best enjoyed later in the afternoon or evening.\n\nRed Poison’s balanced action of the mind and body gives it a range of uses for medical cannabis patients as well. It can temporarily blunt the harsh symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also soothe physical aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Anti-inflammatory properties may dull more minor maladies, like indigestion. Because it’s not likely to speed up thinking or induce a paranoid mindset, Red Poison is a good choice for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.\n\nThe strain was bred to be auto-flowering, meaning that its plants enter maturity on their own, without growers having to gradually adjust the ratio of hours that crops spend in light versus dark conditions. Once seeds are obtained, Red Poison can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor growing calls for a hot and humid climate. Those looking to bring out the strain’s signature red and purple hues should briefly expose plants to temperatures between 10 to 15 degrees below average just before flowering begins. Thanks to the influence of ruderalis varietals in its background, Red Poison flowers within a short weeks. It can offer yields between 37 to 51 grams (or 1.3 to 1.8 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nA great strain for newcomers to cannabis cultivation, Red Poison is also a great smoke for newbie consumers thanks to its even and easygoing effects. The strain is a  good way to wind down after a long day or week of work.\n\n\n"

        "description": "Named for the South Central Mexican state where it grew indigenously, Oaxacan Highland is a sativa landrace strain. In the 1970s, this variety of cannabis enjoyed great popularity in the United States, thanks to relatively porous borders and a lax domestic policy, prior to the so-called War on Drugs instigated by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. With its trippy effects and distinctive flowers, Oaxacan Highland has become legendary in the days since its introduction. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 23%.Actual flowers of Oaxacan Highland may be unrecognizable to consumers of modern commercially-cultivated and harvested cannabis. When trimmed and cured, these flowers appear less like blossoms and more like wispy, elongated ferns. The long and skinny leaves are not naturally inclined to adhere to one another, instead spiraling loosely outward from their central stems. These leaves are typically a vivid kelly green, streaked with brown; sometimes, phenotypes of this variety also have high concentrations of the pigment anthocyanin, which results in patches of deep purple if cold weather occurs late in the growing process. A dusting of white trichomes and curly red pistils cap off these eye-catching flowers.When properly cured, Oaxacan Highland carries and earthy taste that delivers notes of spice and incense, almost similar to indica Afghani’s trademark aroma. These buds also have a sharp and fruity berry scent that brightens up the strain's overall impression. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers releases some hints of roasted cocoa or coffee. When combusted, these rich scents coalesce in a smooth, easily ingested smoke. On the exhale, Oaxacan Highland’s thick smoke tastes fruity and woodsy, with the distinct aroma of pine and cedar.Surprisingly, given its sativa genetics, Oaxacan Highland is a creeper whose high unfolds slowly over the course of several hours. At first, effects may manifest as an increase in blood pressure around the eyes and temples, along with an increased capacity for saliva production. Within short order, these odd sensations are matched by psychedelic distortions of the senses. Certain sights -- especially bright colors -- can take on a new intensity or dimension, appearing oversaturated or even glowing. Many consumers also notice that this strain can distort their depth perception (making walking difficult) and can induce strong feelings of time moving more slowly. If properly relaxed and able to ease into these phenomena, though, smokers are soon absorbed by Oaxacan Highland’s buzzy and uplifting energy. An increase in cerebral patterns of thinking is common, with thoughts flowing freely from one to the next in uninhibited succession. Rather than disorienting, though, this high is remarkably clearheaded, leaving the user free to engage in conversation or to carry out complex tasks that may be on their agenda for the day. With almost no discernible physical properties, this strain is a blessing for fans of pure sativas who don’t want to be weighed down by couchlock or a foggy mind. Because it’s more energizing than relaxing, this strain is recommended for daytime -- and even wake-and-bake -- enjoyment.Oaxacan Highland’s energetic buzz can have several benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. It can help to sustain concentration, allowing those with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. It may also temporarily relieve the troubling effects of mild to moderate stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, the strain can numb pain, whether it’s related to injury, disease, or simple everyday inflammation like headaches. Because its cerebral effects can create a sense of “mindrace,” Oaxacan Highland is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.With no high-profile efforts at commercial seed cultivation of Oaxacan Highland in the works, prospective growers must obtain clippings of the strain in order to grow identical “clones.” Though the plant is native to hot and humid Mexico, some sources report that Oaxacan Highland has been successfully grown at latitudes as far north as 45 degrees. Since they’re purely sativa, these crops may reach tall heights; indoor growers should regularly trim back any weak or unruly branches. Those looking to bring out the buds’ purple potential should also expose the plants to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins.Harder to find in the U.S. these days, Oaxacan Highland is worth grabbing if you’re able to get your hands on it. A must-try for sativa lovers and for cannabis connoisseurs in general, this strain’s contribution to the cross-breeding gene pool is clear -- it’s been used to spin off both Purple Thai and Montel’s Pride.\n"

        "description": "Puna Budder is a potent hybrid crossed from Hawaiian sativa and Afghani indica landrace strains. Rather than a corruption of “peanut butter,” as you might expect, its name refers to Puna, a region of the archipelago’s big island of Hawa’i. With such prestigious genetics in its background, it’s no wonder that this legendary strain offers a rich aroma and balanced, long-lasting effects. Puna Budder’s THC content has been measured at between 19% and 22%.Puna Budder is known for producing impressively large flowers that adhere in roughly spherical formations; some phenotypes of the strain are more pointed, with spade-like buds. These flowers appear more indica-influenced on first glance, clinging together tightly in compact and dense buds. The olive green leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems and are twisted through with brown and orange pistils. Finally, cloudy white trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these nuggets, giving them a very sticky texture and making them difficult to break up without a grinder.When these buds are properly cured, they give off a sweet, earthy scent that mingles musk with the fragrance of cedar.  On closer inspection, there’s also a less pleasant sour smell that’s almost like rotting or fermenting organic matter. Grinding up buds of Puna Budder yields some pungent hints of skunk. When combusted in a pipe or a joint this strain gives off a harsh, acrid smoke that’s liable to tickle smokers’ sinuses and trigger coughing fits. On the exhale, this thick smoke tastes simultaneously sweet and woodsy.Puna Budder takes effect relatively quickly, exerting a throbbing pressure around the lower forehead and temples. Within short order, the smoker’s thoughts take on an elevated nature, fixating on a single topic or making insightful connections between other ideas and concepts that might not otherwise come to mind. The loud and sometimes fast-paced mindset that comes with these cerebral effects can be put to use in tackling complicated work-related tasks. Alternatively, Puna Budder’s brainy energy can provide a welcome and self-sustaining distraction for those who have to endure such menial tasks as cleaning or photocopying. As this strain’s high wears on or as dosage in increased, feelings of physical relaxation may gradually set in, with a tingle trickling down the spine and gradually spreading outward through the core and limbs. Thought not knocked out or incapacitated, smokers may find themselves less willing to engage in demanding duties. Fortunately, Puna Budder leaves the consumer’s mind alert -- if not exactly motivated -- and able to sustain lucid conversation or otherwise engage with the outside world. This eventual balance of mental and physical stimulation makes this a friendly social strain, sparking free-flowing conversation and good vibes wherever it happens to pop up. Because of its slow taper down in energy, Puna Budder is a great strain for enjoyment between late afternoon and early evening.Puna Budder can also have many applications for medical cannabis patients. The focused mental energy that comes with its onset can be of use to those with attention deficit disorder, helping them to focus on a single task. The strain can also help patients suffering from stress or depression to spend their time more mindfully and consciously. Puna Budder can even soothe pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. Patients who are prone to panic or paranoia should consume this strain with caution, as its cerebral effects can prove overwhelming in the wrong circumstances.Fortunately for eager home growers, TH Seeds sells seeds of Puna Budder through several digital retailers. Those seeking heritage plant stock can also seek out a reputable source from which to buy clippings that can be grown as clones. Once obtained, Puna Budder can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation typically needs a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These short, bushy plants typically flower within a brief 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and are ready for harvest in late September when grown outdoors.This fruity, potent bud is a pleasant surprise for sativa and indica lovers alike. If you break it out in genial social situations, be prepared for this tropical treat’s signature aroma to draw some attention.\n"

        "description": "Martian Candy (sometimes dubbed Martian Candy OG) is an intensely herb-scented strain with indica-leaning effects. This otherworldly bud has a mystical past -- its exact genetic lineage and its original breeders are unknown, although it’s thought to be descended from Og Kush. That said, there’s no denying Martian Candy’s sedative power, which is liable to knock even experienced cannabis consumers out flat. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 16% and 21%.Martian Candy stands out with medium to large-sized flowers that adhere in an almost spherical shape. These buds show off a characteristic indica bud structure, with their leaves curled tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a mottled mix of dark and light green and are twisted through with orange pistils. Finally, a carpet of trichomes covers Martian Candy’s flowers, giving them an icy appearance and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Martian Candy bursts with a predominantly sweet, floral scent. The buds also have an herbal aroma; many users have observed notes of eucalyptus. Grinding up these solid buds releases a hashy, patchouli-like scent, providing possible evidence of OG Kush in this strain’s background. When combusted, this strain burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This rich smoke tastes woody and slightly spicy on the exhale.Martian Candy’s high takes effect relatively quickly for an indica. At first, smokers may feel more tuned in to their physical surroundings and may experience a kind of sensory alteration. This sensation can have a psychedelic edge, time dilation is common and certain sights or sounds can take on a new intensity. This mindset is a good excuse to kick back in a cozy setting with some moody music. In addition to these cognitive changes, Martian Candy proffers a strong body buzz than sends waves of relaxation down the neck, through the core and extremities. Deep breathing may happen more easily and any muscular tension starts to evaporate.Martian Candy’s mental effects are not conducive to productivity, as consumers are more likely to feel cloudy and spacey than focused.  This is not a strain for accomplishing a mountain of work and it’s likely to derail a busy agenda. Instead, savor this richly-scented bud with some like-minded friends who are as interested in cooling off and kicking back as you are. Under the right conditions (or if dosage is increased) Martian Candy is likely to tip its smokers into intractable couchlock. At this point, consumers melt into their surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background -- it may make you feel like a martian in your own home. Because of its sleepy vibes, this variety is best enjoyed at night.Martian Candy’s calming properties can have many applications for medical cannabis patients. Its sedation can take the sting out of aches and pains, whether they’re injury-related or more chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia or arthritis. The strain can also have anti-inflammatory properties, numbing everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Psychologically speaking, Martian Candy may temporarily relieve the symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Its almost narcotic properties can even lull insomniacs into a deep and therapeutic sleep. Because this bud is unlikely to bring about intense, recursive patterns of thinking, it is a good option for those who are prone to panic or paranoia, as well as those who have a low THC tolerance.No breeders have yet made seeds of Martian Candy available on a commercial scale. Instead, prospective home growers should obtain clippings of a mature plant from a reliable source in order to grow genetically identical clones. These plants can be grown indoors and out, although outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to have a squat, bushy silhouette and growers should be sure to “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that may prevent light and air from reaching low-growing flowering nodes. Martian Candy flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and offers a roughly average yield of flowers.Martian Candy’s smooth and calming high makes it great for social settings as well as for introspective solo use. This potent, long-lasting bud is a must-try for indica lovers.\n"

        "description": "Easy Bud is a hybrid with uncommon roots. Rather than indica or sativa, this strain is descended from a lesser-seen ruderalis variety. Ruderalis plants can be remarkably easy to grow, hence this strain’s name. Easy Bud was developed by Dutch company Royal Queen Seeds. Unfortunately, this unique strain’s lineage is undocumented -- but suffice to say that Easy bud offers moderate indica effects and a relatively long-lasting high. Its THC content has been measured at between 10% and 17%.Easy Bud is marked by relatively large and cohesive flowers. When trimmed, the buds have a distinctly tapered formation, somewhat like miniature Christmas trees. Notably, these flowers seem to have a hybridized bud structure: while dense and indica-typical at their core, the leaves grow loosely outward at the fringes in a more sativa fashion. This effect results in deep, coral-like creases in the pattern of the leaves. The leaves themselves are a pale sea green and are wound through with hairy yellow pistils. Finally, glassy white trichomes give these buds a very sticky texture.A bright citrus aroma wafts up from the cured flowers of Easy Bud. A second whiff reveals a very funky pungency, similar to that of Cheese. Meanwhile, grinding up these tight buds gives off some notes of spice and pepper. When burnt, Easy Bud gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke leaves behind a taste of sour lemon, along with some skunk on the exhale.Easy Bud offers a surprisingly subtle and gradually mounting high. Several minutes after toking, smokers may detect a tingle in the upper face. At the same time, they may notice their senses sharpened into a new kind of awareness -- certain external stimuli may take on new dimensions or significance, while thoughts may flow in a more freely-associative manner. This is not to say that Easy Bud is especially cerebral, though. Instead, consumers are able to settle into its mental stimulation with ease and little-to --no mindrace. The strain’s ability to induce an upbeat, carefree mindset makes it an asset in busy social situations, where it can spark lively conversation and a sense of camaraderie. As time passes, Easy Bud slides its users gently into a deep physical relaxation. Eyelids and limbs may begin to feel weighty, while deep, restorative breathing begins to happen more easily. While not strong enough to be totally couch locking or paralyzing, Easy Bud’s effects are substantial enough to distract the consumer from whatever they may have been doing. As such, this hybrid shouldn’t be relied on for accomplishing complex, analytical tasks. Because of its generally sedate and soothing vibes, Easy Bud is recommended for evening and nighttime use.Easy Bud’s subtle effects can be of use to medical cannabis patients as well. Its early, attentive properties make it a good concentration aid for those with attention deficit disorders. Meanwhile, the strain’s mood-lifting effects can have great temporary benefits for mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. Physiologically speaking, the strain can dull pain, whether it’s temporary and injury-related or deep-seated (as due to conditions like fibromyalgia). It may also take care of minor inflammations like indigestion and headaches. Because it is not known for triggering the kind of deep, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, Easy Bud is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.True to its name, Easy Bud is a very resilient grow and a great option for newcomers to cultivation. Royal Queen regularly keeps seeds in stock for sale online. Once obtained, the strain can be grown indoors or out, although a hot and semi-humid climate is recommended for outdoor cultivation. That said, Easy Bud’s excellent genetic profile has made it resistant to adverse growing conditions like temperature variations, mold, and disease. These short bushy plants flower within an impressively short 6 weeks when grown indoors. At harvest time, they offer up about 100 grams (or 3.5 ounces) of flower per plant.Easy Bud makes an ideal starter strain for cannabis newbies -- its moderate THC content allows for a smooth and pleasant high. The strain is also a worthwhile smoke for more experienced fans, whether they prefer indicas or sativas.\n"

Its versatility makes it enjoyable for both solo and social use and its high is said to last longer than average. Named after the Greek monster of myth, this Medusa is a legend in her own right. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 20%.Medusa is marked by medium to large flowers than cling together in a tapered, conical shape. They have a dense bud structure that betray their indica roots. This strain’s leaves are a mossy green and are twisted through with pale yellow to bright orange pistils. Finally, like parent strain White Widow, Medusa’s flowers are almost white with trichomes, secreting psychoactive resin that make this strain both potent and difficult to break up without a grinder.When properly cured, Medusa gives off a musky, earthy aroma that also has faint notes of cocoa. On closer inspection, some users also detect sweet berry flavors. Grinding these buds up or breaking them open releases a distinct funk from parent strain Skunk.

This mindset can serve as an accompaniment to task-based analytical work as well as more open-ended, creative jobs. In some cases, consumers also experience strong sensory distortion that can verge on psychedelic, like time dilation and changes in depth perception. Medusa be a good way to spice up annoying everyday activities like running errands or doing dishes.As time passes, a body high creeps in, weighing down limbs and eyelids while allowing users to breathe more deeply and easily. These sedative effects can take the edge off of any previously buzzy, energetic mood.

Because of its taper down from energy into mellow relaxation, Medusa is best enjoyed during the late afternoon to early evening.Medusa’s far-reaching effects can also have many applications for medical cannabis patients. Its clear-headed lucidity can help those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task.

Physiologically speaking, Medusa may also soothe deep-seated aches and pains as well as minor afflictions like headaches and nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or paranoia should consume Medusa with caution, as its early cerebral effects can prove too intense for some.Fortunately, Nirvana has made seeds of Medusa available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success requires a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its plants reach a medium height that can be easily accommodated in indoor spaces. This strain flowers within 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors and offers patient growers a yield of about 37 to 46 grams (or 1.3 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant. Finally, Medusa can be a very pungent grow; those looking to keep their indoor growing operations discreet should invest in odor-control measures like exhaust fans or carbon air filters.Medusa’s therapeutic and balanced effects make it sure to appeal to both indica and sativa lovers alike. If you break it out in social situations, bring enough to share, as this strain’s pungency is sure to turn some heads.\n"

        "description": "Monkey Paw is a sativa-dominant hybrid hailing from the scrappy and inventive old school of cannabis breeding. Supposedly created in Michigan, this bud is a cross between three landrace strains that were among the only varieties of cannabis available in the United States in the 1960s and 70s: sativas Columbian Gold and Acapulco Gold and indica Afghani. The product of these fabled buds is a pungently fruity flower with alert and long-lasting effects.Monkey Paw’s flowers are only small to medium in size and cling together in tight, popcorn-like clusters. These buds have a loose, sativa-type structure, with fluffy leaves spiraling outward and loosely clinging to their central stems. In fact, Monkey Paw is said to be named for the resemblance of its flowers to a gnarled, twisted monkey’s paw. The strain’s leaves are a dark shade of olive green, although some phenotypes also show off bright patches of purple. These surprising hues are the result of anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics which are activated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, a blanket of cloudy white trichomes covers Monkey Paw’s buds, making them very sticky and difficult to break up without a quality grinder.Monkey Paw’s complex aroma has some distinct top notes of berry and grape. On closer inspection, this fruitiness also has a dank edge, almost like fermented organic matter. Meanwhile, grinding up these buds yields hashy and rich odors, a testament to the influence of grandparent strain Afghani. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Monkey Paw gives off a smooth, easily palatable smoke that carries simultaneous flavors of fruit and skunk on the exhale.The high from Monkey’s Paw hits quickly. In addition to feeling a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples, smokers may pick up on an increased tendency toward intense, cerebral thinking. Thoughts can jump from one to the next in free association; those who tend toward introspection will have plenty to dwell on. In social settings, these buzzy properties may spark rambling conversations and friendly vibes. Fortunately, the uptick in cerebral thinking is not likely to overwhelm smokers, instead keeping them lucid and focused. Monkey’s Paw can serve to enhance the texture of daily activities like cleaning or exercising. In the right set and setting, this strain is also a good choice for accomplishing a pile of work, whether that work is analytical and task-based or more creative and open-ended.Monkey’s Paw comes with few discernible physical effects. Some may notice a slight heaviness in the core and limbs, but this relaxation is not likely to pin them in place. As such, this high is a good way to set the stage for kicking back with a book or some atmospheric music in order to take the edge off of a long day. Monkey’s Paw’s energy persists as the high wears on. As dosage is increased, though, the strain can launch smokers into a more cloudy and trippy headspace, leaving them less likely to be productive and focused. Because it is so stimulating, this is a good option for daytime (and even wake-and-bake) use.Monkey’s Paw can even have application for medical cannabis patients. Its sustained sense of focus can allow those with attention deficit disorders to execute complicated tasks. The strain’s mood-elevating effects may also temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Monkey Paw can soothe aches and pain, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like fibromyalgia and lupus. The bud’s anti-inflammatory effects can also take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. Patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should consume Monkey Paw with caution, as its cerebral effects can take a turn into paranoid territory.Unfortunately, no breeders have made seeds of Monkey Paw available on a commercial scale. Prospective growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” Plants can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. This strain flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and offers a relatively low yield of flowers.Somewhat difficult to come by, Monkey Paw is worth trying for those lucky enough to come across it. Its hard-hitting effects are great for brightening up the everyday.\n"

The strain is the creation of Paradise Seeds, who have also fostered Sensi Star and Delahaze, and is derived from a sweetly-scented variety of Skunk. Wappa’s long-lasting potency has earned it accolades like Canada’s Cannabis Champs Cup in 2014 and the Euro Copa de Canarias in 2011. Wappa’s THC content has been measured at between 11% and 22%Wappa sets itself apart with large, remarkably solid flowers that hold a spadelike shape, tapering from a broad base into a sharply-pointed tip. These buds have the dense, tightly packed structure often associated with indicas. The leaves themselves are a mottled variety of dark and light green and are twisted through with hairy orange and yellow pistils. Capping off these bullet-shaped buds is a coat of amber trichomes that gives the flowers a slightly yellow glow.When properly cured, Wappa has a strong, almost sickly-sweet aroma that verges on skunkiness. Accenting these complex top notes is a light citrus scent. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking apart the thick buds intensifies this strain’s skunkiness. When burnt in a pipe or a joint, Wappa gives off a very smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes simultaneously herbal and skunky on the exhale.Wappa offers a creeper of a high, taking as long as 15 minutes before revealing the extent of its soothing effects. As users slip into this strain’s heavy high, they tend to feel a tingle around the temples are forehead. There’s also a progressive feeling of relaxation that cascades down through the spine, slowly radiating out through the core and limbs. Wappa comes with some mental stimulation as well -- smokers may find themselves fixated on a single concept or jumping around in free association from one idea to the next. That said, this strain’s mindset is more conducive to creative daydreaming than to completing difficult, task-based work. Because of its smooth, easy vibes, Wappa is a good way to enhance social situations, as it can provoke free-flowing conversation and camaraderie when shared with like-minded friends. Beware that Wappa has been pointed to as a culprit for dry, red eyes and cottonmouth. As the high progresses, Wappa is prone to pinning smokers in place and shutting out the rest of the world. In high enough doses, this strain can even lull its sedated enthusiasts into a deep and restful sleep. It should go without saying that Wappa is a strain best reserved for nighttime(and bedtime) enjoyment.Wappa’s sedative power can also have many uses for medical cannabis patients. Its laid-back energy can temporarily improve symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. Its numbing physical effects can also take care of aches and pains, whether they’re chronic and disease-related or less serious, like headaches. The bud’s ability to provoke hunger also makes it a useful appetite for those who may have lost their daily appetite to disease or to harsh treatments like chemotherapy. Finally, Wappa is effective in counteracting stubborn cases of insomnia with its therapeutic, sleep-inducing paralysis. Because it is rare for this strain to induce fast-paced, cerebral thinking, it is a good option for patients who are prone to paranoia or panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Fortunately for home growers, Paradise has made seeds of Wappa available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. That said, Wappa is said to be an especially hardy grow that can withstand unexpected adverse conditions. Like many indica, the strain’s plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Growers may need to periodically “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that may inhibit growth among lower flowering nodes. Wappa flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors. It offers a yield of about 1.5 ounces of flower per square foot of plant.Wappa is a luxurious path to relaxation and a must-try for indica lovers. When sharing it with friends, make sure you bring enough bud, as the strain’s pleasant odor is likely to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "The Kalamata region of Greece is popularly associated in the U.S. with its spectacular olives -- but did you know that Kalamata is also the source of some top-notch cannabis? Kalamata is an exceptional sativa that testifies to Greece’s potential to turn out some quality bud. With possible origins in sativa strains from Asia and Africa, Kalamata offers buzzy, head-focused effects.Flowers of Kalamata are unmistakable sativa in terms of their physical structure. These buds tend to be medium to large in size and have a long, spindly formation more often associated with heirloom landrace varieties like Thai stick than with other modern varieties of commercially-cultivated cannabis. The strain’s thin leaves twist outward from their central stems and seem to have an almost fluffy texture. These leaves are a mossy dark green and are occasionally twisted through with pistils that range in color from orange to red.Kalamata’s flowers give off a pleasant aroma of lemon and pine when they are properly cured. Also present is a refreshing hint of mint, somewhat reminiscent of staple sativa strain Haze. Meanwhile, grinding up or picking apart these flowers gives off an earthy musk. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Kalamata burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes citrusy and woodsy on the exhale, leaving the overall impression of an artificially-scented home cleaning product.Kalamata hits the smoker quickly with a sudden pressure in the forehead and around the temples. If they attempt to stand up after toking on this region sativa, some users make experience slight dizziness or disorientation. What follows is a trippy distortion of visual perception. Certain sounds and colors can take on a new intensity. In some cases, consumers have described an oddly cinematic quality to their vision. If smokers are so inclined, they can amplify Kalamata’s trippy visual sensations with media like atmospheric music or visually-engaging films. Those who are feeling more productive than psychedelic, though, can take advantage of this bud’s cerebral mindset. Mentally stimulated consumers may indeed find themselves inordinately focused on any ideas or projects in front of them, making them uniquely predisposed to work on complex or demanding tasks on their agenda. Alternatively, Kalamata can lend itself to more freewheeling, open-ended jobs like sketching or brainstorming. This strain is not widely known for its physical properties and, as such, those toking on Kalamata in order to feel relief from physical pain or tension may be disappointed. Instead, enjoy this Mediterranean gem during daylight hours as a way to enhance your thoughts or to make your chores a bit more tolerable.Kalamata’s energetic properties can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its ever-present feeling of focus can be a boon to those with attention deficit disorders, helping them to concentrate on a single task. Furthermore, that same imminent feeling of mental engagement can temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Physiologically speaking, Kalamata’s anti-inflammatory properties can soothe irritations like headaches and nausea. Those who are prone to panic or anxiety should consume this bud with caution, as the “mindrace” associated with its onset can prove overwhelming under unfavorable conditions.Seeds of this legendary strain do not seem to have been produced for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers should obtain clippings of mature plants of the strain from a trusted source. While there’s little information available on specific best practices for this rare strain, we know that it can be grown indoors or out -- although successful outdoor cultivation calls from a hot and semi-humid climate, similar to that of Kalamata’s native Greece. We also know that these plants can reach a towering 15 feet tall if left unchecked; as such, indoor growers should pune back their crops early on in the vegetative stage.Very difficult to come by (in part due to the Greek government’s restrictive policies regarding cannabis), Kalamata makes a great treat for any pure sativa lover. Toke on this bud and think about the meaning of life, just like Aristotle and Plato may have done centuries ago.\n"

        "description": "Purple Goo is a knockout indica with very clear bag appeal. This strain is a cross between  landrace-descended Afgoo and colorful Purple Kush. The combination results in an eye catching and richly perfumed bud that’s tailor-made for a luxurious smoke session at the end of a long day. Purple Goo’s THC content has been measured at between 18% and 21%.Flowers of Purple Goo set themselves apart right away, appearing medium to large in size and adhere in chunky, elongated formations. These spade-like nuggets betray their indica roots upfront, with a densely-packed bud structure in which the broad leaves curl tightly inwards toward their central stems. The strain’s leaves are most often a patchwork of mossy green and deep purple; these latter hues are due to the presence of pigments in the strain’s genes called anthocyanins, which are activated by colder than average weather during the growing process. Finally, as its name suggests, this strain is indeed gooey, coated in resinous, translucent white trichomes that make these buds hard to break up by hand.Purple Goo carries a sweetly herbal and floral aroma, somewhat reminiscent of staple sativa Haze. Lurking underneath are some hints of woodsy pine. Meanwhile, grinding up these dense nuggets yields hashy, peppery notes that bring grandparent strain Afghani to mind. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Purple Goo burns with a smooth and fruity smoke that tastes like grape candy on the exhale. Notably, the bud’s grape flavor is incidental to its purple coloring; while the flower’s hues are determined by pigments, its aroma is dictated by separate chemical compounds called terpenes.Purple Goo comes with a slow, creeping high that can take up to 15 minutes after consumers have toked on its aromatic smoke before beginning to reveal its effects. At first, smokers may only notice a concerted pressure around the eyes and temples, along with a slight tendency toward increased saliva production. Once adjusted to these physiological responses, users can start to enjoy Purple Goo’s ability to warp the senses. External stimuli like vibrant sights and sounds can take on a new intensity, with colors appearing brighter or sounds seeming more deep or resonant. This trippy amplification can be pushed even further by throwing on a favorite album or immersing yourself in an atmospheric movie or TV show. Beware, though, that once you’ve kicked back and begun to enjoy some leisure time, you may not want to get up again. That’s because Purple Goo’s indica potency kicks in around the same time as its sensory distortion, weighing down the consumer’s limbs, eyelids, and motivation, and inspires many to seek refuge in the closest comfortable surroundings. While it may provoke some elevated thinking and make those under its influence more talkative, Purple Goo is not likely to induce a deeply cerebral mindset; this is not the best strain to toke if you plan to take on a long to-do list. Instead, kick back and enjoy the hazy, heavy sedation that Purple Goo provides. Because of its luxuriously sleepy vibes, this strain is best enjoyed after dark or, depending on your tolerance, right before bed.Purple Goo’s relaxing properties can also be useful for medical cannabis patients. Its soothing, calm headspace can help to temporarily relieve stress, depression, and anxiety. The strain’s ability to numb the body also makes it an analgesic for deep-seated aches and pains, as well as minor irritations like headaches and nausea. Finally, in high enough doses, Purple Goo can even counteract insomnia, lulling susceptible smokers into a deep, restful sleep. Because it isn’t likely to bring about the kind of recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, this strain is recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.No breeders have yet claimed responsibility for creating this potent strain, and none have made its seeds available for commercial sale. As such, prospective growers must obtain clippings of mature plants of the strain in order to foster identical “clones.” Purple Goo can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral ranching, and can be easily accommodated indoors. Additionally, Purple Goo’s indica influence suggests a relatively short flowering time.Thanks to its deep purple coloring and memorable aroma, Purple Goo makes for a fun novelty strain to share with like-minded friends in social situations. Luckily, though, the strain is potent enough to enjoy all on your own after the sun goes down.\n"

        "description": "You’d no doubt be dumbfounded to see a purple gorilla in the wild. Similarly, this Purple Gorilla, an indica-dominant hybrid born in Northern California, can strike its consumers silent with relaxation. While its genetic background is undocumented, it’s possible that this aromatic bud is descended from another purple NorCal favorite -- Mendocino Purps. Whatever its parentage, though, it’s clear that Purple Gorilla is here to stay, with striking buds and a relaxing therapeutic high. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 21%.Purple Gorilla’s flowers tend to be on the smaller side and hold a spherical formation, clinging together in popcorn-like clusters. These globe-shaped nuggets have the dense, compact structure you might expect of an indica. The tightly-curled leaves are a dark olive green, although frequently, phenotypes of the strain also boast patches of purple, ranging from lavender to deep indigo. These eye-catching colors come about thanks to anthocyanin pigments, which trigger their release when activated by cold weather in the growing process. Finally, a blanket of cloudy white trichomes gives these flowers a very sticky texture and makes them appear almost icy when seen from a distance.Purple Gorilla’s largely purple flowers may lead some consumers to assume that the strain carries a predominantly grape aroma. In fact, the pigments responsible for its color do not play a corresponding role in determining its flavor -- instead, Purple Gorilla’s mixture of terpene compounds gives it a mostly earthy, musky scent. That said, there are some incidental grape and cherry-like scents that contribute to the bud’s profile. Combusting these flowers in a pipe or a joint gives off a smooth, flavorful smoke that can have a bit of a peppery kick. On the exhale, Purple Gorilla tastes like a combination of grape, citrus, and pine.Purple Gorilla’s high typically creeps up over the course of several minutes. When it does take hold though, it doesn’t hold back, sometimes temporarily disorienting smokers with its force. The first signs that the strain is working include a flush in the cheeks, as well as a slight throbbing around the eyes and temples. Sometimes, smokers detect changes in their sensory perception, which can range from an impaired ability to discern depth to a strong feeling of time dilation. Even if they aren’t afflicted by trippy side effects like these, though, users are certain to fall victim to Purple Gorilla’s strong physical properties. Those who are already sitting can find themselves paralyzed as their bodies begin to melt into their surroundings. Meanwhile, those who may have been previously active might want to seek out some rest and relaxation under the weight of this bud. While some mental stimulation may be present, usually in the form of freely-associative thinking or a tendency to zone in on single concepts, Purple Gorilla is more likely to leave its consumers lazy and easily amused. This strain can be a nice way to enhance an intimate gathering of friends, or simply a way to turn down the volume on your stress and thought at the end of a long day of work. Because of its soothing, sedative properties, Purple Gorilla is one bud best reserved for enjoyment after dark -- or even just before going to sleep.Purple Gorilla’s heavily sedative effects can also have many benefits for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily take the edge off of troubling conditions like stress, depression, anxiety, and even PTSD. Physiologically speaking, it can also soothe deep-seated aches and pains, as well as minor annoyances like headaches or nausea. For some, the strain can stoke the appetite, serving as a supplement for those who struggle with hunger due to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Because it is not known to bring about bouts of obsessive, recursive thinking, Purple Gorilla is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia, or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Purple Gorilla do not appear to be available for sale online. Prospective growers must instead seek out reputable sources from which obtain clippings of mature plants in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” The plants can be grown indoors or out, although their bushy and squat stature is easily accommodated indoors. Growers looking to bring out the strain’s colorful potential should activate anthocyanins by briefly exposing their crops to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before flowering begins. Purple Gorilla flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors.This potent strain is a must-try for indica lovers, as well as for connoisseurs of purple strains. Treat yourself by saving this bud for a luxurious midnight snack.\n"

        "description": "Purple Nepal is an indica-dominant hybrid with potent landrace roots. This strain is a cross between an indica indigenous to Nepal and tasty Lemon Thai. Though it leans indica, to be sure, Purple Nepal’s sedative high is not typically strong enough to incapacitate users, instead allowing for mellow relaxation. The strain’s fruity flavor and colorful flowers make it even more appealing. Purple Nepal’s THC content has been measured at between 16% and 25%.Flowers of Purple Nepal catch the eye with their color and distinct structure. These buds range in shape from elongated and almost cylindrical to tapered and spade-like. They cling together in the dense, compact bud structure associated with other mostly indica varieties. The leaves are this strain’s real showpiece, with a veritable camouflage pattern of mossy green and dark purple. These latter colors come about when anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are stimulated by cold weather during the growing process. Finally, translucent white trichomes cover these already-colorful buds and make them appear somewhat pale when seen from a distance.When properly cured, Purple Nepal gives off a pleasant, fruity aroma, redolent of tart berries. On closer inspection, there’s also a eucalyptus-like odor that provides an herbal base scent. Meanwhile, grinding up the flowers gives off prominent earthy and musky notes. When burnt, Purple Nepal gives off a smooth and easily palatable smoke. On the exhale, this smoke carries a musky flavor that mixes with a tropical citrus taste, passed on from the Nepalese parent strain.Purple Nepal has a slow onset, only revealing itself several minutes after users have savored its richly-flavored smoke. Some initial signs of action include a tingle around the jawline and temples, along with a sudden flushing in the cheeks. At this point, smokers may also be more likely to experience sensory distortions in the form of an intensification of some sights and sounds, as well as a trippy sense of time passing more slowly. If able to adjust to and process these phenomena without panic, consumers are then in for a long, sedated ride. Purple Nepal quickly begins to untie any knots of muscular tension, laying users out flat and giving them an increased capacity for deep and restorative breathing. As the outside world begins to recede into the background, any prior motivation tends to dissipate as well. Indeed, although Purple Nepal has some subtle effects on consumers’ thinking, it isn’t likely to plunge them into a headspace of recursive, cerebral thinking. As such, this may not be the best bud to toke on before embarking on a complex, task-based job -- but it could be just the thing for kicking off a creative project or an open-ended brainstorming session. Purple Nepal also exerts a positive influence in social situations, where it can help to inspire free-flowing conversation and easy camaraderie. As this high wears on or as dosage is increased, couchlock becomes more and more of a possibility, as does sleep. As such, Purple Nepal is best consumed during the later afternoon or early evening, when its sedative nature can be fully appreciated.This strain’s soothing properties can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its mood-altering effects can temporarily banish the symptoms of stress, depression, and even anxiety. It can also dull physical pain, whether temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like lupus or arthritis. Meanwhile, the strain’s anti-spasmodic properties may alleviate disorders like restless leg syndrome. As noted, in large enough quantities, Purple Nepal can even work against insomnia. Because it is not likely to bring about obsessive, cerebral thinking, this strain is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Seeds of Purple Nepal are not available for sale online. As such, home growers must obtain clippings from mature, healthy plants of the strain in order to foster “clones.” The plants can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation requires a semi-humid climate with consistent daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Shortly before flowering begins, growers should expose their crops to temperatures between 10 and 15 degrees below average in order to bring out their full purple potential. Purple Nepal flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in mid October when grown outdoors.This colorful bud is a good option for indica lovers who don’t want to be completely incapacitated off the bat. It can be a great choice for a rainy day alone, as well as a night in with friends.\n"

        "description": "Night Train is an indica-dominant hybrid with the sedative power to rock you to sleep like a train speeding you home under dark skies. Created by California-based Elemental Wellness, this strain is a cross between aromatic Jasmine and sativa powerhouse Trainwreck. It offers a memorably spicy flavor profile alongside some deeply soothing physical effects. This strain’s THC content has been measured at between 9% and 23%.Night Train is marked by large flowers that adhere in thick, solid pieces. These buds have an elongated, cylindrical shape and hold the densely-packed structure usually associated with other indica varieties. Its leaves are a bright shade of spring green and are twisted through with curly yellow and orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structure meant to catch pollen from would-be fertilizing male plants. Finally, a coating of translucent amber trichomes covers the inner and outer surfaces and nooks of these buds, making them both very potent and very sticky.When properly cured, Night Train gives off a distinctly spicy, acrid scent. On closer inspection, there are some dank notes of damp earth and skunk as well. Meanwhile, grinding up Night Train’s buds releases an astringent chemical scent, reminiscent of ammonia-based cleaning products. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, this strain gives off a harsh smoke that may induce coughing or watery eyes for some. On the exhale, it leaves behind pungent fumes of pepper and skunk.Night Train’s high hits quickly, considering that it is an indica-leaning strain. Initial effects may manifest as a throbbing pressure around the temples and forehead. This feeling is followed by changes in sensory experience. These may range from an intensification of certain sights and sounds to trippy sensations of time dilation or depth perception. As smokers adjust, they are able to ease into these psychedelic effects and supplement them with visually-engaging movies or atmospheric music. Although Night Train comes with some slight increase in cerebral activity, this is nowhere on the order of parent strain Trainwreck and is unlikely to lead to mindrace. Instead, the main attraction here is the body high, which progressively creeps down the spine and through the core and limbs, radiating waves of easy relaxation. At this point, users feel a decrease in any lingering physical tension, as well as an increased capacity for deep breathing. Because of its unfocused, lazy properties, this is not a strain to enjoy before tackling a pile of work or kicking off a busy agenda. Instead, share Night Train with some like-minded friends in order to spread calm, happy vibes. Alternatively, enjoy this indica alone for some introspective “me time.” As dosage is increased, note that this bud is likely to bring about couchlock, and eventually, sleep. As its name suggests, Night Train should be savored at night, or just before bed.This calming, almost narcotic bud can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. It can temporarily take the edge off of the unpleasant symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It may also soothe physical pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or more mundane, like a headache. As noted, Night Train is also able to lull users to sleep and may be a welcome antidote to insomnia. Because it is unlikely to bring about the kind of intense, recursive thinking that can lead to paranoia, this strain is a good option for those who are prone to panic or have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Elemental Wellness has made seeds of Night Train available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors calls for a semi-humid climate with consistent temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Like many indicas, Night Train grows short and bushy -- growers should regularly “top” their crops by trimming away any broad fan leaves that could block light and hinder the flowering of low-growing nodes. This strain flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. Growers should also note that it can be an especially pungent grow; those looking to maintain discretion should invest in odor control measures like exhaust fans.Night Train is a heavy, stony indica that’s sure to appeal to cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. Somewhat difficult to come by, it’s worth snatching up for its pleasantly sedative effects.\n"

        "description": "Purple Wreck is an indica-dominant hybrid with the power to impress even experienced cannabis consumers. A cross between the very popular sativa Trainwreck and colorful, aromatic Purple Urkle, Purple Wreck was created by prolific breeders DNA Genetics, the producers of Chocolope and LA Confidential. With a strong, relaxing body high and a bold flavor to boot, Purple Wreck is a great choice for end-of-day use. Cannabis testing lab Analytical 360 has found samples of the strain to have THC levels from 10% to a whopping 31%.Purple Wreck sets itself apart with large, well-formed flowers. These buds look like mini Christmas trees, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Their structure appears to a hybrid of indica and sativa influences -- although compact and dense on the interior, the leaves spiral outward at the exterior with a fluffy texture. These leaves themselves are the strain’s real showstopper, wowing consumers with a mottled mix of olive green, lavender, and violet. These purple hues come about when anthocyanin pigments in the strain’s genetics are activated by colder than average weather. Finally, sticky white trichomes cover all surfaces of these large nuggets, makes them appear dewy and icy.When properly cured, Purple Wreck gives off a sweet, vegetal odor, somewhat like hay. Lurking underneath these top notes are some notes of grape and berry. Grinding up these solid flowers yields a rich, diesel-like scent. When it is burnt, Purple Wreck gives off a smooth and pleasant smoke that tastes like berry on the exhale with some hints of sap. Notably, any discernible grape odors or flavors are incidental to the strain’s purple hues; while its color is determined by pigments, its aroma is dictated by different compounds called terpenes.Purple Wreck is a creeper that may take anywhere from 5 to 15 to begin unveiling its effects. At first, smokers may feel a throbbing around the eyes and temples. Once adjusted to these effects, though, it’s smooth sailing. Consumers describe a strong feeling of well-being and emotional uplift. Overextended brains are easily distracted from the stresses and preoccupations of the day, suddenly absorbed by more transitory phenomena like bright lights or resonant sounds. Thanks to the Trainwreck in its background, Purple Wreck exerts some sativa mental energy and alertness. This mental stimulation is not especially cerebral, though, and may not be well-suited to complex, work-related tasks. Instead, smokers can enjoy creative liberty, simply able to daydream and bask in this strain’s warm glow. Purple Wreck’s main attraction is its therapeutic body high, which sets in gradually, first sending waves of relaxation through the core and limbs and eventually numbing (and maybe even disorienting) consumers. Any muscular tension may be suddenly relieved, while deep, restorative breathing may come more easily. As the high progresses, this section can become more and more intense. Couchlock and drowsiness are real possibilities under the right circumstances. Because of Purple Wreck’s slow drop in energy levels, it is best reserved for late afternoon to evening use.Purple Wreck’s versatile properties can also have applications for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s sense of positivity and lightness can provide temporary relief from the symptom of stress, depression, and anxiety. This bud’s slow-moving body melt can also be an effective treatment for chronic, disease-related pain, as well as minor irritations like headaches and nausea. In high enough doses (and sufficiently comfortable conditions), Purple Wreck can even lull insomniacs to sleep. Because it is unlikely to trigger episodes of obsessive, recursive thinking, this strain is a good option for those who are prone to panic or paranoia.Seeds of Purple Wreck can be purchased through several digital retailers. It can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching; growers should occasionally trim away any broad fan leaves at the top of the plant that can block light and air from reaching any low-growing flowering nodes. Those looking to accentuate this strain’s titular purple potential should expose their crops to cold (but not freezing) temperatures just before the flowering stage. Purple Wreck flowers within a short 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors and typically offers a large harvest.Purple Wreck’s well-balanced relaxation is an excellent way to enjoy some much-needed solo time. The strain can also be fun at parties, though, where its colorful flowers can make a good conversation starter.\n"

        "description": "Blue Monster is a knockout indica-leaning hybrid with a complex genetic background. This strain is derived from G13, Blueberry, Northern Lights, and a Mexican landrace. Created by UK-based Goldenseed Company, the purveyors of Jack Frost, this strain offers both a bold, memorable aroma and a pervasive body high, sure to appeal to cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. Blue Monster’s THC levels have been measured at between 15% and 23%.Blue Monster is marked by flowers that are medium to large in size. These buds tend to have chunky, irregular shapes, ranging from roughly spherical in shape to elongated and slightly tapered. Their structure is characteristically indica, with small leaves that curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a dark shade of forest green; sometimes, phenotypes of the strain even boast shades of dark blue and purple. These latter hues are the result of pigments called anthocyanins that ca produce blue and purple colors when stimulated by cold weather in the growing process. Finally, cloudy white trichomes make these colorful flowers even more eye-catching and account for their high THC levels.The prominent scent wafting up from cured buds of Blue Monster is that of fresh blueberry. On closer inspection, there’s also an astringent, chemical tang, somewhat like ammonia or cat urine. Grinding up the dense buds releases some pungent fumes of diesel. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Blue Monster burns with a harsh, acrid smoke that may trigger a coughing fit. This smoke tastes like sweet and sour berries on the exhale.Blue Monster offers a creeper of a high that may take a while after smokers have ingested its thick smoke to begin revealing itself. Initial effects may include heaviness in the head and a throbbing around the eyes and temples. Soon after these symptoms subside, though, smokers may detect some changes in their sensory perception, ranging from a slight intensification of sights and sounds to a trippy feeling of time dilation. Such psychedelic properties can be amplified even more by turning on some moody music or a visually-engaging film. Blue Monster is not known to bring about deep bouts of intense, analytic thinking. As such, this may not be the best strain to toke on before beginning work on complicated tasks. Instead, Blue Monster exerts a deep relaxation, helping to soothe bodily tension and to temporarily distract from mental preoccupations. This strain’s physical sedation can be so strong that it may even bring about some anxiety and disorientation for consumers with a low THC tolerance. In the right set and setting, though, Blue Monster is just the thing for taking the edge off after a long day. It’s as enjoyable when savored alone as it is when shared with a few like-minded friends. If the dosage is increased, Blue Monster can even lull susceptible users to sleep. It should go without saying, then, that this bud is best reserved for enjoyment after dark.Blue Monster’s subdued qualities can have some applications for medical cannabis patients as well. It can temporarily improve the troubling symptoms of stress and depression. It can also soothe physical pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or more minor, like headaches and indigestion. As noted, Blue Monster can also counteract insomnia in large enough doses. Because its body high can be especially strong and disorienting or depersonalizing, those who are prone to panic should consume this strain with some caution.Seeds of Blue Monster are available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor success calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching and can be easily accommodated indoors. Growers who want to bring out the strain’s trademark purple hues should expose their crops to nighttime temperatures that are between 10 and 15 degrees below average just before flowering begins. Blue Monster flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors and is ready for harvest in late September through early October when grown outdoors. The strain’s high yields may require staked supports like wooden dowels to prevent overburdened branches from drooping.Despite its name, there’s nothing, especially intimidating bout this full-flavored bud. If anything, its likely to scare monsters away from under beds and inside closets, granting a peaceful sleep.\n"

        "description": "Blue Satellite -- not to be confused with related strain Blue Satellite #2 -- is a high-flying sativa with long-lasting effects. This strain is derived from a sativa phenotype of perennial favorite Blueberry and from flavorful Shiskaberry. The result is a bud with predominantly cerebral effects and a distinctive, complex flavor that may be an acquired taste for some. An excellent daytime strain, Blue Satellite’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 22%.Blue Satellite’s impressive flowers are distinguished by their shape and size. Ranging from medium to large, these buds cling together in distinct spade-like shapes, tapering down from a broad base into a pointed tip. Despite the strain’s sativa leanings, its flowers have an indica-type bud structure, densely-packed, with their leaves curling tightly inward toward their central stems. Finally, translucent white trichomes dot the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these solid nuggets, accounting for their high psychoactivity.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Blue Satellite draws from the genetics of parent strain Blueberry to offer the strong, unmistakable odor of blueberries. Unlike DJ Short’s more common cut of Blueberry, though, Blue Satellite also has a strong chemical scent lurking underneath, with notes of ammonia and pencil shavings. Meanwhile, grinding up these dense buds releases some hints of pepper and spice. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Blue Satellite burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes like blueberries and citrus with a lingering chemical aftertaste.Blue Satellite wastes no time, striking the user right away with its sativa force. At first, consumers feel a pressure around the eyes and temples, as well as some flushing in the cheeks. Smokers are typically quickly enveloped in a newfound cerebral energy, with their minds fixated on certain ideas or concepts that may not otherwise seem interesting. Many users may also have a freely-flowing internal monologue the jumps from one topic to the next. Although this kind of hyperactive thinking may be anxiety-inducing under the wrong circumstances, it can prove very useful for powering through a long to-do list. Blue Satellite’s focus can easily apply itself to complex work-related tasks; alternatively, it can add some background energy to mundane jobs like cleaning or running errands. This strain is also said to have a freewheeling euphoric energy that can illuminate social situations, sparking easy conversation and camaraderie. As the high wears on, a subtle body stone creeps in, providing slight relief for any tense or sore muscles. Blue Satellite is unlikely to induce couchlock, though -- in fact, the strain’s physical and mental effects combine to produce a holistic, therapeutic vibe. If users are so inclined, they can harness this energy to engage in activities that involve both body and mind, like exercise, dancing, and sex. Because it is more energetic than sedative, Blue Satellite is best consumed during the day; it’s also very enjoyable as a wake-and-bake treat.Blue Satellite may also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its focus can aid concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. It may also provide temporary improvement in some symptoms of mild to moderate depression. Physiologically, Blue Satellite soothes aches and pains, whether they’re temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to disorders like lupus and arthritis. As noted, the onset of this high’s cerebral effects can be overwhelming; Blue Satellite is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Blue Satellite do not appear to be available for sale online. Instead, prospective growers should obtain clippigns of mature plants from a trusted source in order to foster “clones.” The plants can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Blue Satellite’s sativa influence suggest that its plants grow particularly tall and may require pruning. These sativa roots also suggest a longer flowering time of 9 weeks or longer.Better for active pursuits than for kicking back at home, Blue Satellite is certain to launch its consumers into new orbits of cerebral energy.\n"

        "description": "Blue Train, sometimes known as Blue Haze Train, is a sativa-dominant hybrid that has both bag appeal and potent cerebral effects. This strain was conceived by prolific growers Rare Dankness Seeds, the same purveyors of Tangerine Kush, and is a cross between the ubiquitous Blueberry and Nevil’s Wreck. This bud wows consumers with an alert mindset that is soon tempered by mellow relaxation. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 16% and 20%.Blue Train’s flowers are medium to large in size and adhere in a solid, elliptical formation. These buds are compact at their core but somewhat ragged and fluffy at the edges, thereby betraying their sativa roots. The spiraling leaves are a mossy green and are threaded through with vibrant orange pistils. Cloudy white trichomes coat the surfaces of these thick buds, making they very sticky and difficult to break up by hand.Blueberry is the predominant scent that wafts up from these impressive flowers. A second whiff also reveals sweet and sour notes of skunk. Meanwhile, grinding up these nuggets yields some herbal hints of sage, possibly passed on from parent strain Nevil’s Wreck. When it is combusted in a pipe or a joint, Blue Train burns with a harsh and acrid smoke that can sting the palate. On the exhale, this thick smoke carries a sweet and slightly sour blueberry flavor.Despite its mostly sativa properties, Blue Train is a creeper that takes hold gradually. Several minutes after coughing on its smoke, users may begin to feel a flushing in the cheeks, along with a pressure around the temples or an increase in salivation. Once acclimated to these sensations, though, consumers may find themselves immersed in their own internal monologues, bouncing between thoughts or associations. This mindset can enable chattiness and good vibes when shared with like-minded friends in a party setting. In more subdued surroundings, Blue Trin can enhance focus on complex, problem-oriented tasks; it may also open up new pathways of creativity to facilitate brainstorming. Some time after feeling these cerebral effects, consumers may begin to sink into a more relaxed and weighty feeling. Waves of sedation roll down from the neck and radiate outward through the spine and core. While these feelings may relieve any lingering muscular tension and can allow for deep and restorative breathing, Blue Train is not like to incapacitate smokers completely -- instead, the soothing sensation on its backend serves to take the edge off of its energetic onset. This strain’s enhancement of both physical and mental faculties makes it a good way to enjoy activities that involve full body and mind coordination, like playing video games or exercising. Because of its decline in energy levels, Blue Train is recommended for later afternoon to evening use.Blue Train’s versatile effects can also have several benefits for medical cannabis patients. Its initial brain buzz can assist concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. The bud’s easygoing, uplifting vibe can also alleviate the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. On the physical end of the spectrum, Blue Train may soothe pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related, or more common and incidental, like nausea. Note that because it can bring about intense, recursive patterns of thinking, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or anxiety.Seeds of Blue Train are not produced for commercial sale. As such, prospective home growers should obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants in order to foster genetically identical “clones.” The strain’s plants can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoor depends on a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures in the 70s (Fahrenheit). These sativa-inflected plants tend to grow tall and may need to be trimmed back in order to fit in limited indoor spaces. Blue Train flowers within 8 to 9 weeks when grown indoors. It offers a high yield of flowers at harvest time -- in fact, growers may need to artificially support their crops’ branches with stakes and string to keep them from drooping under the weight of Blue Train’s large buds.With its multifaceted high, Blue Train is good for having a day that transitions from productivity to thorough relaxation. If you bring it around to shared with friends, be sure to have plenty, as this strain’s pleasant aroma is sure to attract some attention.\n"

        "description": "Descended from two powerhouse strains, Blueberry Jack is a bold, fruity hybrid that’s sure to please cannabis newcomers and veterans alike. This strain is a cross between DJ Short’s Blueberry and perennial favorite Jack Herer and offers all the refreshing aroma and potency of both parent strains. With an optimal balance between head- and body-focused effects, this strain has something for everyone. Its THC content has been measured at between 12% and 20%.Blueberry Jack is distinguished by its well-formed flowers which range in size from small to medium. These buds have a classically indica structure, densely packed, and with small leaves that curl tightly inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are a vivid shade of spring green and are twisted through with hairy brown and orange pistils. A dusting of cloudy white trichomes makes these flowers somewhat difficult to break up by hand.When properly cured, these flowers give off the unmistakable blueberry aroma of their famous parent strain. On closer inspection, there’s also a woodsy scent of fresh pine hanging out underneath. Grinding up the thick buds yields some of the herbal lightness often associated with Jack Herer. When burnt, Blueberry Jack gives off a very smooth and easily-ingested smoke. This smoke tastes like a combination of blueberry and citrus on the exhale.Blueberry Jack hits fast, with an action that centers on the brain. Soon after experiencing initial effects like an increased blood pressure at the temples and around the eyes, users are launched into new heights of cerebral activity. Certain thoughts and ideas can inordinately occupy the smoker’s attention, making this early phase of the high a good way to try and concentrate on complex, analytical tasks. Some users may find that their trajectory of thought jumps around in rapid free-association, making concentration on a single job somewhat difficult; in such circumstances, Blueberry Jack can simply be a fun way to share some giggles and free-flowing conversation with like-minded friends. After some time, a tingle may take hold in the consumer’s limbs and core as the strain begins to exert body-focused indica effects. While such relaxing properties may have some headed for the closest comfortable surface to lounge on, Blueberry Jack is not likely to knock users out right away. Instead, any previously exacting, complex thoughts may become more dreamy and rambling. Additionally, this more relaxing stage of the high can be a fun and trippy way to enjoy some immersive music or visually-engaging TV shows or movies. However you choose to enjoy Blueberry Jack, though, strive for late afternoon through early evening consumption -- smoked too early in the day, this strain can cause afternoon sleepiness; smoked right before bed, it can keep users alert and wired.Blueberry Jack can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. Its cerebral energy can help some of those with attention deficit disorders to sustain focus on a single task. Its immediate sense of vibrancy can also help to temporarily improve the symptoms of stress and depression. This strain can also be an analgesic for physical pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia. In some cases, the bud can also stimulate the appetite, making a useful supplement for those who’ve lost their hunger to disease or to medication. Because it can bring about a fairly intense cerebral state, those who are prone to panic or paranoia should consume Blueberry Jack with some caution.Seeds of Blueberry Jack do not seem to be available for digital retail. Instead, those looking to grow the strain should obtain clippings from mature plants in order to foster clones. Plants can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. Luckily, these short and bushy crops are easily accommodated indoors. Blueberry Jack flowers within 9 weeks when grown indoors.Blueberry Jack is a must-try for indica and sativa lovers alike. Its appeal speaks to the staying power of its parent strains -- two of the cannabis market’s most successful staples.\n"

        "description": "Buddha Haze is a predominantly sativa strain that enable meditative focus and concentration. It was created by Big Buddha Seeds (who have also given us Blue Cheese) as a cross between Amnesia Haze and fruity Brazilian strain Manga Rosa. Offering a buzzy, active head high, this is one strain best enjoyed during daytime. Its THC content has been measured at between 15% and 26%.Like traditional East Asian representations of the Buddha himself, these buds are substantial in size. The chunky buds hold together in formations that range from roughly spherical to elongated and elliptical. Their leaves are a yellowish green and are twisted through with curly brown and orange hairs -- which are actually pistils, structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Finally, translucent amber-colored trichomes cover the inner and outer nooks and crannies of these dense flowers, giving them a slightly golden glow.When properly cured, flowers of Buddha Haze give off a sweet, tropical aroma. There are also some earthy, musky base notes underneath. Meanwhile, grinding up these nuggets releases a tangy, herbal scent, possibly due to the Haze in its background. When burnt, Buddha Haze’s flowers give off a smooth and easily palatable smoke that has a nutty, cocoa-like flavor on the exhale.Like many other sativas, Buddha Haze strikes smokers quickly, exerting a fast-acting pressure around the eyes and forehead. Some users may also experience a sudden flush in the cheeks. Consumers are soon distracted from these symptoms, though, by a sudden uptick in cerebral thinking. Smokers can take on a new focus, stopping to dwell on a single concept longer than they ordinarily might. Buddha Haze also confers an energetic quality that can cause ideas to jump around in rapid succession as the consumer is struck by sudden and novel associations. As such, the strain makes a good complement to working on demanding and complex tasks, as it can aid focus. It may also help inspire bouts of open-ended brainstorming for working on more creative projects. In a certain set and setting, this strain’s energy my even inspire its consumers to get up and move, whether it’s to run some errands or to get a day’s exercise in. With relatively few physical properties, Buddha Haze is not known to induce a passive, lazy mindset; smokers may feel some subtle physical relaxation while remaining mentally acute. As such, this smooth and pleasant high is a great way to pass time with some like-minded friends, whether you’re playing board games or just shooting the breeze. Because it’s much more head-focused than sedative, Buddha Haze is recommended for afternoon or even morning use.Buddha Haze can also have some benefits for medical cannabis patients as well. Its sense of focus can help those with attention deficit disorder to sustain focus on single tasks. Its immediacy can help those suffering from stress and depression to spend their time more presently and consciously. Physiologically speaking, Buddha Haze may soothe pain, whether it’s chronic and disease-related or temporary, as due to injury. Because it can bring about a disorienting sense of mindrace, this strain is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Fortunately for home growers, Big Buddha has made seeds of Buddha Haze available for sale. It can be cultivated indoors or out, although success outdoors depends on a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Thanks to their sativa roots, these plants can grow very tall; indoor growers should trim back their crops early on in order to maintain a manageable height. Note that Buddha Haze has a very long flowering time of anywhere between 11 to 13 weeks when grown indoors. It is ready for harvest in early November when grown outdoors. Luckily, though, this strain rewards patient growers with a very high yield of flowers.With a therapeutic high and powerful roots -- parent strain Manga is said to have spiritual qualities -- Buddha Haze offers a great opportunity for some valuable reflections. This strain is a must-try for fans of high-powered sativas.\n"

        "description": "Double OG is a very potent indica-dominant strain that combines genetics from Big Bud, Afgoo, and regional favorite SFV OG Kush. Possibly named for the double dose of Afghani dance in its background (it’s a building block for both Afgoo and Big Bud), this strain is a true knockout. It’s tailor-made for lazy, hazy days or evenings on the couch. Double OG’s THC content has been evaluated at between 16% and 26%. Double OG’s flowers are very visually impressive, with a tendency toward large to jumbo-sized buds that may be passed on from parent strain Big Bud. These hugs nugs cling together in a characteristically dense indica structure, with leaves curling tightly inward. The leaves themselves are a vibrant spring green and are twisted through with yellow and orange pistils. Finally, icy white trichomes cap off these already colorful flowers, accounting for their high potency.Flowers of OG give off a mellow, earthy scent of wood. This aroma is complemented by some tangy fumes of diesel. Meanwhile, grinding up the bud’s compact flowers yields notes of skunk, possed due to the Skunk #1 in Big Bud’s background. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Double OG gives off a smoke that may be harsh and acrid, triggering coughing. The smoke tastes sour with some pungent diesel on the exhale.Double OG takes a while to show itself, sometimes waiting as long as 15 minutes after smokers have finished coughing on its smoke. The high initially manifests as a throb in the temples and around the eyes, accompanied by a sudden heaviness in the head. This weighty feeling soon spreads down through the neck and spreads outward through the core and limbs; smokers who are standing may feel the sudden urge to sit down. As they acclimate to Double OG’s powerful physical relaxation, some smokers may also begin to notice some changes in their consciousness. This warping of sensory perception may include phenomena like distorted depth perception or a strong sense of time dilation. If you’re so inclined, these psychedelic effects can be amplified even further by putting on some moody, atmospheric music. Frequently, though, Double OG simply makes its users want to kick back and enjoy this pud’s pervasive body high, which can soothe any lingering muscular tension. As time passes, the strain’s laid back vibe provides the perfect setting for a long binge-watching session or for some giggly and free-flowing conversation with friends. Double OG is probably not the best choice for accomplishing task-based work that requires close attention. In high enough doses, the strain can even lull drowsy smokers to sleep. More often than not, you’ll want to use this strain at night -- unless you’re not planning on accomplishing anything for the day.Double OG’s sedative effects can also have applications for medical cannabis patients. IT can temporarily distract from the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety. It can also dull physical pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to diseases like fibromyalgia or arthritis. As noted, in the right circumstances, Double OG can be a powerful sleep aid for those with insomnia. Because it is not likely to cause intense bouts of recursive thinking, Double OG is a good option for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC.Seeds of Double OG are not available online. As such, prospective home growers must obtain clones (grown from clippings of existing plants) from a trusted source. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Plants of Double OG tend to grow short and bushy, with strong lateral branching. Growers should occasionally “top” their crops by trimming away broad fan leaves that can block light and air from nourishing any low-growing flowering nodes. Finally, once these plants mature and begin to flower, growers should support the branches with stakes or dowels to prevent them from drooping under the weight of these very large flowers.Consumers should note that while Double OG is relaxing, it can be too potent for total newcomers to cannabis. For more experienced smokers, though, it can be a luxurious treat at the end of a long day or week of work.\n"

        "description": "Cambodian landrace strains are potent and pure sativas, with an appealing tropical scent. Native to the country’s mountainous Southwestern regions, the plant is also cultivated by residents of the country’s fertile central plains. Though cannabis is technically illegal in Cambodia, laws against its cultivation and consumption are not strictly enforced (although visitors to the country should show caution and respect if seeking it out). While it’s difficult to come by outside of Southeast Asia, this landrace is known for its buzzy, uptlitin high. Its THC content has been measured at between 14% and 26%.As with cannabis from Thailand (Cambodia’s neighbor to the Northwest), flowers of Cambodia are unmistakably sativa. The buds, med to large in size, hold together in an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. The long leaves spiral loosely outward from the central stems and can easily be torn away. These leaves themselves are a very dark shade of green and are twisted through with dark brown pistils. Translucent trichomes give the buds a whitish sheen when seen from afar.When properly cured, flowers of Cambodian smell dank and earthy, somewhat like damp soil. A closer inspection also reveals a fruity, tropical tang lurking underneath. Grinding up these buds releases a slightly astringent, chemical scent. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Cambodian burns with an acrid smoke that can tickle the palate and sinuses. On the exhale, this smoke has an earthy, floral flavor.Despite mostly sativa genes, this strain creeps up on the user, sometimes taking as long as 15 minutes after the first toke to reveal its presence. Initial effects may take the form of a throbbing around temples and eyes, as well as an increase in salivation. The subsequent of sense of mindrace, in which thoughts take on a seemingly elevated quality and can jump around in free association, may prove overwhelming for some. In the right set and setting, though, this energetic mental stimulation provides an ineffable sense of euphoria. Cambodian can facilitate both deep, analytical focus and imaginative improvisation and brainstorming. With almost no discernible physical properties, Cambodian is not likely to slump its consumers into a state of passivity and couchlock. Nevertheless, it’s also a good way to enhance less productive circumstances: it can set the tone for enjoying some introspective solo time or a chatty afternoon with friends. Cambodian’s mental stimulation can also result in some trippy distortions in sensory perception. Smokers may experience certain sights and sounds with a new dimension or intensity, and many may have strong feelings of time dilation. These psychedelic qualities make the powerful strain a welcome addition to a hike or a camping trip. Because of its stimulating, energetic effects, Cambodian is recommended for daytime use; if consumed before bed, it’s almost certain to keep smokers awake and wired.Cambodian bud can have many uses for medical cannabis patients as well. Its heady, thoughtful high can be a good aid for those with attention deficit disorders. It can also provide some welcome relief for those affected by mild to moderate stress or depression. On the physical side, it can soothe physical pain, whether it’s due to serious conditions like fibromyalgia or is simply incidental, as due to injury. Because its patterns of recursive thinking can mount into paranoia under the wrong circumstances, Cambodian is not recommended for those who are prone to panic or anxiety.Unfortunately, seeds of Cambodian are not available for sale online. Those looking to grow the landrace at home should seek out a trusted source from which to obtain clippings that can be fostered as clones. It can be cultivated indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid, Mediterranean-like climate. That said, this strain’s hardy landrace genes may make it resistant to adverse conditions like temperature fluctuations. These plants can grow very tall; those cultivating indoors should trim back their crops to maintain manageable heights. Cambodian flowers within 9 to 10 weeks when grown indoors.If you’re lucky enough to make it to Cambodia, sample some of the native bud at one of the local “Happy Pizza” shops, which serve up pies with cannabis-laced toppings. Cambodian sativa is a worthy goal for intrepid cannabis connoisseurs.\n"

        "description": "Caramelo is a sativa-dominant hybrid with a smooth, dessert-like aroma. This strain was created by breeder Delicious Seeds -- also responsible for Cheese Candy and Qleaner -- and is derived from the genetics of fragrant Lavender. With a strong landrace backbone and potent, well-balanced effects, it’s no wonder Caramelo has won multiple European cannabis awards. Its high is also said to last longer than average. Caramelo’s THC content has been measured at between 17% and a staggering 31%.Caramelo’s flowers are small to medium in size and adhere in elongated formations that narrow into a pointed tip. The buds have a characteristically indica structure, with their leaves densely and tightly packed. These leaves themselves are arguably the strain’s most compelling visual feature: a patchwork of pale sage and vivid spring green. Red and yellow pistils twist their way through these colorful leaves. Finally, a crown of frosty white trichomes gives Caramelo’s flowers a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Caramelo’s flowers smell very sweet, with some overtones of toasty cocoa. On closer inspection, there is also a dank, earthy aroma. Meanwhile, grinding up or breaking open Caramelo’s flowers gives off herbal and floral base notes, passed on from Lavender. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Caramelo burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke tastes nutty and sweet on the exhale, almost like a flavored coffee.Unsurprisingly given its sativa background, Caramelo’s high hits the user quickly. Initial effects include a mounting blood pressure around the eyes and temples and some flushing in the cheeks. Once they adjust to these odd sensations, smokers may note that their thoughts have taken on an elevated quality -- they may be more attuned to surrounding stimuli like bright colors or loud sounds, and may even feel their thoughts jumping around in free association. This cerebral energy is accompanied by a kind of euphoria in which any prior stresses or preoccupations of the day begin to dissipate. Given this combination of mental stimulation and a laid-back attitude, many consumers may find that Caramelo can facilitate creativity allowing for open-ended brainstorming or artistic projects. This strain’s ability to clear anxiety and inhibitions even makes it a powerful aphrodisiac in the right set and setting. After a while, waves of physical relaxation roll down the neck and spread through the spine and core. Previously active smokers may want to take a load off and lounge on the closest comfortable couch. Caramelo isn’t likely to totally incapacitate its consumers, though -- instead, the easygoing feeling that creeps in on its backend can serve to take the edge off of any previous jumpiness or overstimulation from the high’s onset. Users can kick back and still maintain mental lucidity, leaving them free to take on a mountain of work or simply to enjoy some buzzy conversation with friends. Because of its gradual taper off into relaxation, Caramelo is recommended for enjoyment between late afternoon to early evening.Caramelo can also have some applications for medical cannabis patients. Its uplifting vibes can temporarily soothe the symptoms of stress and depression, while its cerebral focus can aid concentration for those with attention deficit disorders. Caramelo can also relieve physical pain, whether it’s temporary, as due to injury, or chronic, as due to conditions like arthritis or lupus. Because its intense, recursive patterns of thinking can be overwhelming in some cases, Caramelo is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.Seeds of Caramelo are available for purchase directly from Delicious Seeds. The strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation requires a hot and semi-humid climate. That said, this strain’s hardy landrace roots -- which include genetics from Afghanistan, Hawaii, and South Asia -- make it a resilient crop that can be resistant to adverse growing conditions like mold.

        "description": "Catfish is a sativa-dominant strain with a funky aroma and an elevating high. Named for its oddly fishy smell, this strain was created in Michigan by breeder Midnight Roots as a backcross of the popular OG #18. Catfish offers smokers upbeat, energetic effects. Its potency earned it the title of Best Sativa in the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup held in Michigan. The strain’s THC content has been measured at between 15% and 20%.Catfish impresses right off the bat, with medium to large-sized flowers. These chunky nugs hold together in elliptical shapes and have more of an indica bud structure -- likely due to the influence of OG Kush in Catfish’s background -- with leaves that overlap as they curl inward toward the central stems. The leaves themselves are a mottled mix of pale and mossy green and are twisted through with vivid orange pistils. Finally, a coating of translucent white trichomes gives these colorful flowers a silvery sheen and a very sticky texture.When properly cured, Catfish’s most obvious aroma is an astringent chemical odor, reminiscent of ammonia-based cleaning products. There’s also a dank, hashy scent lurking underneath -- one that becomes more intense when the buds are broken open or ground up. When Catfish is burnt, these oddly-matched scents combine in a sour and acrid smoke that may make eyes and sinuses water. On the exhale, this smoke indeed carries an oddly fishy flavor.Catfish hits the smoker right away with a soaring head high. In addition to increasing blood flow to the temples and around the eyes, consumers may experience an increase in salivation. What follows these strange sensations is a discernible increase in energy levels that may make some consumers want to get up and move. As such, this strain can be a good way to start the day or to tackle a long to-do list. It may even inspire some to go for a jog or head to the gym. Catfish also stimulates the smoker’s thoughts, leading them to focus more intently on ideas or concepts that they might not otherwise find interesting. For some, this cerebral mindset can manifest as a fast-moving and freely associative train of thought. This elevated thinking may be useful for executing complex, analytical tasks. This strain isn’t only good for active pursuits -- with its generally uplifting and therapeutic energy, Catfish can help to lubricate social situations, where it can spark lively conversation and camaraderie. It can also be fun to toke on while kicking back and listening to a favorite album or starting a binge-watching session. Note that one commonly reported side effect of this buzzy strain is a strong case of the munchies. It should go without saying that Catfish is best consumed during the daytime, when its long-lasting effects can be fully appreciated; it even makes a great wake-and-bake treat. If smoked right before bed, this strain is liable to keep users totally wired.Catfish’s wide-reaching effects can also be of use to medical cannabis patients. Its constant sense of focus may help those with attention deficit disorders to concentrate on a single task. The strain’s upbeat energy can also temporarily soothe the symptoms of mild to moderate stress and depression. As noted, Catfish can induce hunger, making it a potential stimulant for those who have lost their appetite to disease or to harsh treatments like chemotherapy. Because its buzzy, cerebral vibes can be too intense for some, Catfish is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.Seeds of Catfish are not available online. Prospective home growers should obtain clippings of the strain from a reliable source that can be fostered as “clones.” This strain can be grown indoors or out, although successful outdoor cultivation calls for a semi-humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Growers concerned with keeping their operations discreet should invest in odor control measures like carbon air filters, as this can be a very pungent crop. Catfish flowers within 9 to 11 weeks when grown indoors.A must-try for fans of pure sativas, Catfish provides all-day stimulation. Its positive, uplifting mood makes it the perfect way to enhance a trip to the great outdoors.\n"

        "description": "Chiquita Banana is a fruity, well-balanced hybrid that boasts some prestigious genetics. This strain is a cross between tasty Banana OG and old standy hybrid OG Kush and carries that full-bodied potency and flavor of both parent strains. Named after the ubiquitous distribution of tropically-grown bananas, Chiquita Banana is the creation of California-based Utopia Farms. Its THC content has been measured at near-record high levels of between 25% and 34%.When properly trimmed, flowers of Chiquita Banana are small to medium in size and hold together in roughly spherical, popcorn-like shapes. These buds have a characteristically indica structure, with leaves curled densely inward toward their central stems. The leaves themselves are not unlike the flesh of a banana - a mix of pale yellow and bright spring green. While relatively few trichomes twist their way through these compact flowers, they are absolutely covered in cloudy white trichomes, accounting for the strain’s sky-high psychoactivity.Chiquita Banana’s flowers give off a tropical sweetness, which, while not exactly banana, has some pleasant notes of citrus. On closer inspection, there’s also a sweet, slightly skunky funk. Grinding up these dense flowers gives off rich odors of hash and spice. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Chiquita Banana burns with a smooth and easily palatable smoke. This smoke leaves behind a musky orange scent on the exhale.This buzzy strain hits the consumer very quickly, beginning with an increase in circulation to the temples and the cheeks. The head rush can also result in some dizziness for seated smokers who stand up too quickly after toking. Soon thereafter, users feel a marked increase in their capacity to think and pay attention. Thoughts may center on certain, otherwise uninteresting concepts, revealing new layers and associations. This kind of focus makes Chiquita Banana an ideal strain for accompanying analytical and work-related tasks. Chiquita Banana may also inspire bouts of creative brainstorming, freeing preoccupied minds from their usual inhibitions. As the high wears on or as dosage is increased, this strain begins to exert the body high that makes its Kush ancestry so popular. Consumers may feel a trickle of relaxation roll down their spine and radiate outward through their core and limbs. Any lingering muscular tension dissipates as deep breathing happens more freely and easily. It’s not unheard of for the suddenly relaxed user to melt into their immediate surroundings as the outside world recedes into the background. Luckily, Chiquita Banana’s mental acuity does not fade, even as its stoney effects set in. In its later stages, this bud is a great way to kick back and enjoy an atmospheric, engaging movie -- or simply to enjoy some introspective solo time. Chiquita Banana should be enjoyed between late afternoon and early evening, when its gradual decrease in energy levels can be fully savored.Chiquita Banana’s versatile properties can have applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its lucid sense of focus may be an aid to those with attention deficit disorders. The strain’s mood-lifting properties can also temporarily relieve the symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety.. Physiologically speaking, this bud can be an analgesic for deep-seated aches and pains as well as temporary injuries and inflammations. Because it can be so unusually potent, Chiquita Banana is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia, or who have a low tolerance for THC.Utopia Farms has not released seeds of Chiquita Banana for sale online. As such, prospective growers should obtain clippings of the strains from a reliable source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” While there is little information available on specific best practices for cultivating this strain, we know that like many hybrids it can be grown indoors or outdoors in hot, humid climates. The strain’s sativa leanings also suggest tall plants that may need to be occasionally trimmed back in order to fit in limited indoor grow spaces. Its background also implies a long flowering time of at least 9 weeks.On the merits of its THC content alone, Chiquita Banana is one strain worth seeking out. Its versatility makes it a great way to enhance daily life, whatever your agenda.\n"

Quebec Gold confers an even balance of mental and physical effects along with a decidedly funky aroma. It’s a cross between two potent indicas: M-39 and another Canadian strain appropriately named Freezeland. This bud’s THC content has been measured at between 18% and 26%.\n\nQuebec Gold’s medium to large flowers are visually very impressive, adhering in a distinctly conical formation. These buds have a densely-packed structure that’s typical of many other indica-inflected strains. The tightly-coiled leaves are a vibrant shade of yellowish green, giving credence to this precious bud’s name. Amber-colored trichomes coat the compact flowers, giving them a golden hue and contributing to their potency.\n\nWhen properly cured, Quebec Gold’s flowers have a strong, stinky pungency. Although there’s a slight lemony scent underneath, skunk and diesel notes predominate. Grinding up intensifies these odors and also reveals a cheesy tang. When combusted in a pipe or a joint, Quebec Gold burns with an acrid smoke that’s likely to tickle the palate and cause and coughing fit. This harsh smoke carries citrus and skunk flavors on the exhale.\n\nQuebec Gold is a definite creeper, with a high that mounts progressively until the smoker is struck by its vibrant effects. Once they do detect its presence, consumers tend to pick up on physical symptoms like an increased blood pressure around the temples and forehead, as well as a slight flush in the cheeks. Mentally, the strain reveals itself (at least at first) with a new kind of thinking, in which thoughts and ideas may flow from one to another via connections that might not be otherwise apparent to the user. For some, Quebec Gold may also impart a kind of subtle, uplifted mood that expels any prior stresses or preoccupations, making it a great way to unwind after a long workday, especially when paired with a hot bath or a glass of wine. Within an hour or so, this bud’s formidable indica lineage kicks in with relaxation that spreads through the limbs and core. Any earlier motivation may quickly evaporate and give way to a kind of lazy, dreamy mindset that’s great for socializing but not as good for getting work done. This soothing body high becomes gradually stronger -- especially if a user’s dosage is increased -- and may cause the sensation of floating or becoming depersonalized from one’s body. While deeply sedative for some, such psychedelic sensations may be disorienting for those who are prone to panic or have a low THC tolerance. In Quebec Gold’s later stages, prepare for some full-on couch-lock and have some entertainment within reach: a binge-watching session or a mellow playlist will do just fine. Because it starts off strong but melts into a laid back tranquility, Quebec Gold is recommended for use between late afternoon and early evening.\n\nQuebec Gold’s multilayered high may have applications for medical cannabis patients as well. Its indica buzz can take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression, while its sativa focus may enable concentration for those with attention deficit disorder. Physiologically speaking, this bud may dull disease-related pain as well as everyday maladies like headaches. Because its early effects include strong, recursive patterns of thinking, Quebec Gold may not be the best choice for patients who are prone to panic or paranoia.\n\nFortunately for home growers, seeds of this unique strain are available for sale online. Once obtained, it can be grown indoors or out, although outdoor cultivation calls for a humid climate with daytime temperatures between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These crops grow short and bushy with strong sideways-growing branches and can be easily accommodated indoors. Quebec Gold flowers within 7 to 8 weeks when grown indoors and offers a very high yield of flowers at maturity.\n\nA gem of North American cannabis breeding, Quebec Gold makes a great smoke for indica and sativa lovers alike. The hybrid makes for good times whether you’re hanging alone or lounging with some like minded friends.\n\n"

        "description": "Has it been a while since you’ve had a completely restful night of sleep? If you’re looking for a strain that will give you a nice tingle and a bit of a happy buzz before putting you to bed, Hawaiian Skunk is it. Take a puff and let the Sandman do the rest. Hawaiian Skunk is an indica-dominant plant that offers users low to moderate THC content ranging from 11% to 17%. Its lineage comes from Hawaiian Indica and Skunk #1, giving this bud a perfect blend of uplifting and mellowing highs. Small to medium light green buds give off a fruity aroma that is a bit musky, a bit citrusy, and nicely balanced with a sweet lemony flavor. Skunk and earth round out the bud’s essence while yellow and brown hairs give it a sunny glow.  The clear cerebral rush hits you right away, followed closely by a burst of energy and euphoria. This uplifted feeling can last for hours in some cases and is known to give users a glimpse into their more talkative side. While you dig into this part of the high your body will start to feel the tingle and possible dizziness this strain is known for. Users love its complex flavor, but be aware that too much of a good thing is often a bad thing. This strain has been known to cause paranoia if smoked to excess.  If you suffer from insomnia this bud is the relief you’ve been looking for. Because of its intensely sedative properties, users need only a few hits to get them to a deep sleep. The high may seem deceiving at first as it gives you a bit of an initial head rush, for a short time making users more social, however that is shortly replaced by an extremely heavy body and a foggy mind perfect for bedtime. This strain can be beneficial for users who suffer from nausea and headaches as well as some other mental health issues such as depression and stress, but it is not recommended for primary treatment. This outdoor thriving plant is not a particularly difficult one to grow, though it is highly favorable to natural conditions and may cause you a little bit of a headache inside. You’ll have to watch for sudden growth spurts as this plant is notorious for non-movement periods with sudden jumps in height, making indoor growing tricky. Novice growers would be fine to follow standard techniques and will have no problem gleaning an average yield. Uplifting, dizzying, complex, and sleep-inducing? Sign me up. Users love this strain for a multitude of reasons, but the consensus is the same: the flavors are great, the high is joyful, and it ends in a great night of deep unencumbered rest. Whether you use it medically or recreationally, Hawaiian Skunk provides a pretty solid combo.\n"

        "description": "Hailing from one of the most beautiful and complex areas of the world, Himalayan Gold by Green House Seeds lives up to its name at every turn. Bred from crossing Nepalese Sativa and North Indian Indica, this beautiful strain gives users the feeling they are floating on crisp mountain air. The Himalayas are known for more than just Everest; in fact, they are home to numerous cannabis strains adored the world over. With THC levels at 25% on average and CBD content ranging between 1% and 2%, Himalayan Gold offers users an exceptional combination of head and body engagement. This plant produces incredibly large, fluffy buds which are dark green and brown in color with a palette chalk full of citrus fruit aromas and flavors. This lemony bubblegum flavored bud hits on all of the senses with its spicy notes and gorgeous coloring. It’s soft to the touch and if you listen closely, you can actually hear your heart breaking from its perfection. Himalayan Gold will take your mind on an energizing and creative journey through the skies high above mountain peaks while keeping your body grounded and relaxed. While the sativa effects are up there, users can expect more of a cerebral flighty high rather than a strong body buzz, so expect to be more fluid than rooted. There’s no chance of couch lock here, as these long-lasting effects hit in slow waves that come throughout the day, making this a perfect wake and bake bud. Users love this strain because of its universal applications. Due to its mood-boosting effects, it’s great for treatment of depression, stress, bipolar, and other mood disorders. As it is a stimulant people also find great relief from constipation, nausea, and lack of appetite. Some have even used this strain as an aphrodisiac. Other more common uses are for immediate relief of pain, inflammation, and hypertension. It is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia or anxiety as it is known to give users burst of energy through the high. When grown outdoors Himalayan Gold is known to reach up to 8 feet tall and gives harvesters an above average yield, while indoors the plants remain under 5 feet and produce a slightly smaller bunch. Growers love the spicy, chocolate fragrance the plant emits with some even placing their outdoor plants close to windows for the scent. No need for a vaporizer as this strain is a smooth smoke with robust flavors and aromas you’d like to bottle and wear like cologne. The happy and heady high and light body tingle give this West Asian breed a uniquely bold high without weighing you down. Because of its relatively subtle body effects and its mellow inhale, Himalayan Gold is an ideal bud for new users.\n"

        "description": "Pure Power (sometimes known as Pure Power Plant) is a hybrid that leans towards the sativa end of the cannabis spectrum. The creation of Nirvana Seeds -- who have also given us Bubblicious and Black Jack -- this bud is a cross between super-potent White Widow and Powerplant, a sativa derived from South African landrace varieties. The bud offers heady effects and a dank, citrus-like aroma. Its THC levels have been measured at as high as 22% and as low as 8%.\n\nPure Power makes itself stand out right away with medium to large buds that maintain an elongated, almost cylindrical shape. These slightly tapered flowers look more sativa than indica, with fluffy leaves that spiral loosely outward from their central stems. The leaves themselves are a pale sea green and are visually set off by curly brown and orange pistils. Finally, parent strain White Widow passes on its propensity for high trichome count, making these buds sing with resin and psycho activity.\n\nOn initial inspection of these ragged buds, they burst with the fresh scent of orange blossoms and herbs. A second whiff reveals a more woodsy, pine-like scent. Grinding up or picking apart the flowers releases a more earthy aroma, more often associated with Kush varieties. When combusted Pure Power gives off a harsh smoke that may trigger a coughing fit. This smoke tastes like pine and citrus on the exhale, much like sativa favorite Jack Herer.\n\nPure Power’s potency mostly affects the head and wastes no time doing so -- shortly after consumers have savored its uniquely aromatic smoke, this bud kicks in with a rush of blood that may bring increased salivation and throbbing blood pressure to the face. As the shock of these initial symptoms abates, the user is consumed by some suddenly fast-paced thinking. New ideas or new connections between seemingly unrelated concepts may suddenly occur to the smoker, who may become suddenly lost in their own thoughts. Thanks to this cerebral intensity, Pure Power makes a good strain for studying or for executing complicated analytical tasks. It can also provide the motivation needed to accomplish anything from running errands to getting a day’s exercise. Thanks to its constant flow of thoughts, Pure Power is especially welcome in social settings, where it may keep conversation flowing among friends and new acquaintances alike. This buzzy bud comes with relatively few physical properties and is more likely to trigger red eye and cottonmouth than it is to immobilize smokers with a psychedelic body melt. While its sativa energy is an excellent daytime smoke for experienced cannabis consumers, its sky-high potency may prove to be too much for the uninitiated and may lead to paranoia or, at the very least, jitters. Those able to harness the power of this landrace descendant may find that its mental stimulation can brighten up everything from sex to video games. Because it is largely an active, uplifting smoke, Pure Power is recommended for afternoon (or even morning) use. Those toking at night should prepare to be wide awake for the foreseeable future.\n\nPure Power’s upbeat, active effects may also be of use to some medical cannabis patients. It can help to sustain focus for those with attention deficit disorders, while its slow burn of euphoria can temporarily take the edge off of mild to moderate cases of stress and depression. Anti-inflammatory properties can take care of everyday irritations like headaches and nausea. This strain can also be an effective appetite stimulant for those who have lost their hunger to disease or to treatments like chemotherapy. Because it is fairly intense and cerebral, Pure Power is not recommended for patients who are prone to panic or who have a low THC tolerance.\n\nNirvana has made seeds of this potent bud available for sale online. It can be grown indoors or out; while outdoor cultivation typically requires a hot, humid climate, this strain’s hardy landrace genetics may make it resistant to adverse growing conditions like temperature variations. Plants tend to grow tall and may need to be pruned back a bit if grown indoors. Pure Power flowers within a long 9 to 11 weeks, but offers patient gardeners 37 to 46 grams (or 1.3 to 1.6 ounces) of flower per square foot of plant.\n\nPure Power is an absolute must for cannabis connoisseurs thank to its noble South African lineage and funky aroma. The strain is a great way to share time with friends, whether you’re lounging around inside or trekking out on a camping trip.\n\n"

        "description": "Hindu Skunk is an indica-dominant hybrid that build on the power of its parent strains to deliver a mellow, therapeutic sedation. This strain’s parents are Skunk #1 and an indica Hindu Kush landrace. And while its aroma won’t win this strain any awards, its high might -- it offers a smooth, relaxing trip with some psychedelic effects early on. Hindu Skunk’s THC has been measured at between 11% and 23%.Hindu Skunk is distinguished by solid, well-formed buds that hold an elongated, slightly tapered shape. The chunky flowers maintain a characteristically indica structure, with a dense and compact core. The leaves curl tightly inward toward their central stems and are usually a pale shade of yellowish green. These buds are also twisted through with yellow and rust-colored hairs -- which are actually pistils, botanical structures meant to catch pollen from fertilizing male plants. Finally, a coating of cloudy, amber-colored trichomes gives Hindu Skunk a very sticky texture and a slightly golden glow.Despite its strong genetic backbone, Hindu Skunk’s flavor and aromatic profile are generally thought to be a bit lacking. The flowers mostly emit a dank, earthy scent of damp soil with some skunkiness. There are also some piney and woody accents lurking underneath. Grinding up these tight buds reveals the hashy, pungent odor often associated with its Hindu landrace parent. When burnt, Hindu Skunk gives off an acrid, cough-inducing smoke. On the exhale, this smoke tastes earthy, with a lightly sweet aftertaste on the exhale.True to its indica character, Hindu Skunk is a creeper. Several minutes after users have toked, it begins to exert a pressure around the eyes and temples. Soon after, smokers may feel an odd new stimulation of their thoughts, characterized by surprising associations between seemingly unrelated concepts. The strain can also free up entrenched mental inhibitions, unlocking new pathways of creativity. As such, this bud can be a good way to facilitate work, whether it’s analytical and task-based or freewheeling and creative. At the same time that these cerebral properties take hold, Hindu Skunk can also exert some distortion on the senses; in particular, some smokers pick up on a warping of their depth perception or an uncanny feeling of time passing more slowly. Once settled into Hindu Skunk’s effects, though, many are able to relax in a mindless state of bliss. A pervasive body high seeps in after an hour or so, pulverizing any lingering muscular tension and likewise making any mental worries or preoccupations disappear. Although typically not strong enough to totally couchlock its consumers, Hindu Skunk can certainly take the wind out of a motivated smoker’s sails. If they’re so inclined though -- and have the right kind of company -- this hybrid is said to serve as a strong aphrodisiac, as it achieves an ideal dual stimulation of mind and body. In its latter stages, Hindu Skunk is a good way to unwind with a calming movie or some soothing music -- after all, within relatively little time, it has the seductive power to send susceptible consumers to sleep. Because of its gradual decrease in energy levels and motivation, Hindu Skunk is best reserved for enjoyment during the late afternoon or early evening. Hindu Skunk can also have several applications for medical cannabis patients. The strain’s alert, focused properties can help those with attention deficit disorders to focus on a single task. Meanwhile, its mood-elevating effects may have a temporarily salutary effect on mild to moderate cases of stress, depression, and anxiety. The bud’s body high may soothe physical pain, whether it’s deep-seated and disease-related, like fibromyalgia, or simply an everyday irritation like a headache. This strain is not known to bring about crippling, paranoid states of mind, but nevertheless, patients who are prone to panic or who have a low tolerance for THC should moderate their dosage and consume with caution.Unfortunately, seeds of Hindu Skunk are not available for sale online. Instead, prospective growers should obtain clippings of mature, healthy plants from a trusted source in order to grow genetically identical “clones.” The plants can be grown indoors or out, although success outdoors requires a semi-humid, Mediterranean-style climate with consistent daytime sunlight. The crops are easily accommodated indoors, where they tend to grow short and bushy with strong lateral branching. Hindu Skunk flowers within 8 to 9 weeks and offers patient growers a high yield of flowers.Hindu Skunk is a good all-purpose smoke with a relaxing backend. Its trippy properties can be especially fun to enjoy with enhancements like atmospheric music or some aromatherapy.\n"
